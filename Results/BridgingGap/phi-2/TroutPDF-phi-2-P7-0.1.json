It is widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. In this chapter, we will explore some key concepts and syntax rules of Python.### Variables and Data TypesVariables are containers that hold different types of data. They allow us to store and manipulate information in our programs. In Python, we do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Instead, Python automatically assigns the appropriate data type based on the assigned value.Let's start by creating a variable called \"age\" and assigning it the value 25.```pythonage = 25print(type(age))```  ",
