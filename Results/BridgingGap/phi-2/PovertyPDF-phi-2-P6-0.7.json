We will learn about how people's lives change over time and what factors contribute to their well-being. By understanding these concepts, we can work towards creating a better future for everyone.Section 1: What is Poverty?Poverty refers to a state where individuals or families lack the necessary resources to meet their basic needs. These needs include food, shelter, clothing, healthcare, and education. When someone does not have enough money to buy these things, they may struggle to live a healthy and fulfilling life.Section 2: Measuring PovertyTo understand poverty, economists use various indicators to measure the well-being of individuals and households. One commonly used indicator is the poverty line, which represents the minimum income required to meet basic needs. People who earn less than this poverty line are considered to be living in poverty.Section 3: Factors Affecting PovertyThere are several factors that contribute to poverty. One important factor is income inequality, which means that some people have more wealth and resources than others. This can lead to disparities in access to education, healthcare, and other essential services.Another factor is unemployment. When people do not have jobs, they may struggle to afford basic necessities. Additionally, social and cultural barriers can also contribute to poverty. For example, discrimination based on gender, race, or ethnicity can limit opportunities for certain groups of people.Section 4: Economic Growth and Poverty ReductionEconomic growth plays a crucial role in reducing poverty. When a country experiences economic growth, it means that there is an increase in the production of goods and services. This leads to higher incomes and improved living standards for the population.However, economic growth alone is not sufficient to eliminate poverty completely. It is important to ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach all members of society, including those who are marginalized or disadvantaged.Section 5: Exploring Poverty Using ABMAbstraction-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool that allows us to simulate and understand complex systems, such as poverty dynamics. In this section, we will explore how ABM can help us gain insights into poverty reduction strategies.By creating a virtual world where individuals and households  ",
