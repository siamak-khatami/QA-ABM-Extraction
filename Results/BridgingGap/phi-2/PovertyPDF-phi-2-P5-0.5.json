Poverty refers to a situation where people do not have enough money or resources to meet their basic needs. It is important to understand how poverty affects individuals and societies so that we can find ways to help those in need.One way to study poverty is through a method called Agent Based Modeling (ABM). ABM is a computer program that simulates the behavior of individual agents, such as households, and how they interact with each other and their environment. By creating a virtual world where these agents live and make decisions, researchers can observe and analyze the dynamics of poverty.The ABM described in this paper focuses on exploring the dynamics of poverty lines. Poverty lines are thresholds that determine who qualifies as poor and who does not. These lines are often based on factors like income, consumption, or access to essential services. The goal of the ABM is to simulate different scenarios and see how changes in these factors affect poverty rates.To create the ABM, researchers first define the characteristics of the agents in the simulation. They assign each agent an income level, which represents their financial resources. This income level is determined by a mathematical function that takes into account various factors such as education, occupation, and location. The income level is then distributed using a normal distribution, meaning that most agents will have incomes close to the average, but some may have higher or lower incomes.Once the agents are assigned their initial income levels, the simulation begins. Each year, the agents receive a new income based on the previous year's income and any changes in the simulated environment. The simulation runs for multiple years, allowing researchers to observe how poverty rates change over time.During the simulation, the agents make decisions about how to allocate their income. Some agents may choose to save money for emergencies or invest in assets like property. Others may spend their income on basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. These decisions are influenced by factors such as personal preferences, social norms, and government policies.By running the simulation multiple times with different parameters, researchers can explore different scenarios and compare the results to real-world data. This allows them to validate the accuracy of the ABM and gain insights into the dynamics of poverty.Overall, ABM provides a powerful tool for studying poverty  ",
