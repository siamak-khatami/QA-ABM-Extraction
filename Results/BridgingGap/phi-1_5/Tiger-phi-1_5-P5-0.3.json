    "0": "  The space is a simulated environment consisting of two types of habitats - forests and grasslands. Forests consist of trees while grasslands consist of open spaces covered with grasses. Both types of habitats are divided into sub-environments called patches. Each patch is further divided into smaller areas known as cells. Cells contain various organisms including plants, insects, birds, and mammals. Within each cell, there are multiple individuals belonging to different age groups. These individuals engage in activities like hunting, mating, and defending their territories. The simulation also includes a feature where individuals can lose their territories to challengers over time. This helps maintain the balance between dominant and subordinate individuals within the habitat. Overall, the simulated space provides a realistic representation of the natural world and allows researchers to study the dynamics of animal populations in controlled environments.Illustration:           Sarah and John both work in the same office building. Sarah always brings her own reusable water bottle and coffee mug, while John buys disposable cups and bottles every day. One day, the office manager announces that they will start charging for single-use plastic cups and straws starting next week. Sarah is happy because she won't have to buy new cups anymore, but John is upset because he doesn't want to pay extra money for something he already uses. He decides to continue buying disposable cups and bottles, even though it's bad for the environment.Q&A:1. Why does Sarah bring her own reusable water bottle and coffee mug?Answer: Sarah brings her own reusable water bottle and coffee mug to reduce waste and save money.2. How does John feel when he hears about the office charging for single-use plastic cups and straws?Answer: John is upset when he hears about the office charging for single-use plastic cups and straws.3. Why does John decide to continue buying disposable cups and bottles?a) Because he wants to save moneyb) Because he doesn't care about the environmentc) Because he thinks it's easier than bringing his own cupAnswer: b) Because he doesn't care about the environment4. What could John do instead of continuing to buy disposable cups and bottles?Answer: John could start bringing his own reusable cup or mug to work.When the fire alarm went off, everyone had to evacuate the building quickly. Some people ran out of the door, while others grabbed their belongings.Once upon a time, in a small town named Greenfield  ",
