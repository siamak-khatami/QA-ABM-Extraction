For example, if the input were \"hello world\" and \"l\", it would return 2 because the letter l occurs at position 2 in the word hello.Here's what I have so far:def firstOccurrence(string1, string2):      for i in range(len(string2)):          if string2[i] == string1[i]:              return iprint(firstOccurrence(\"hello world\", \"l\")) # Output: 2However, when I run this code, I keep getting an error message saying \"TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable\". I've tried changing my loop to use enumerate() but still no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated!A:You need to convert your int to str before using it as an index into string2. You could also use enumerate instead of a loop.def firstOccurrence(string1, string2):      index = -1      for idx, char in enumerate(string2):          if char == string1[idx]:              index = idx      return indexprint(firstOccurrence('hello', 'll'))# 2A:Try this one :def firstOccurrence(string1, string2):      for i in range(len(string2)):          if string2[i] == string1[i]:              return i      return -1print(firstOccurrence(\"hello world\", \"l\")) # Output: 2A  ",
