Introduction to Scatter PlotsScatter plots are useful tools for visualizing relationships between two variables. In environmental science, scatter plots can help us understand patterns in data such as temperature vs rainfall or air quality vs ozone concentration. To create a scatter plot in Python, we first need to import the `matplotlib.pyplot` module and call its `scatter()` function. Here's an example code snippet:```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]y = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()```  ",
