    "0": "  The 'income' variable of 'HouseHold' agent represents the household's disposable income after taxes and other deductions. It is calculated by subtracting the government transfer payments received from the individual's tax return from their total income. The 'value_boundaries' attribute specifies the range of values within which the income falls. For example, it could be [-100000, 100000], indicating that the income must fall between $100,000 and $200,000. The 'equation' attribute defines how the income is calculated. It could be linear, logarithmic, exponential, or a combination thereof. Finally, the 'order_number' attribute indicates whether the income is calculated annually or monthly. The 'frequency' attribute determines how often the income is updated during the simulation period.# Chapter: The use of Python Matplotlib for Policy Analyst## Section: Applications of Matplotlib Subplot for Policy Analyst### Subsections:1.

Introduction to Matplotlib SubplotMatplotlib subplot is a powerful tool for creating multiple plots in one figure. As a policy analyst, you may need to compare different datasets side by side or visualize trends over time. With Matplotlib subplot, you can easily create these types of visualizations without having to manually draw separate graphs.```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)y1 = np.sin(x)y2 = np.cos(x)fig, axs = plt.subplots(2)axs[0].plot(x, y1)axs[1].plot(x, y2)plt.show()```  ",
