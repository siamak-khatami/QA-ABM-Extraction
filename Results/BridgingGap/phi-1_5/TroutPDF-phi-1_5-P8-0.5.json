They allow developers to track the execution flow of their programs and identify bottlenecks or other issues. In Python, the trace module provides a simple way to create and run traces with ease.To create a trace, simply call the `trace()` function with the name of your script and the desired level of detail. By default, the trace will show the entire stack trace, including the current line being executed and the lines above it. However, you can adjust the level of detail by passing in a positive integer argument.Here's an example of how to create a basic trace with the `trace()` function:```pythonimport tracedef my_function():      my_list = []      for i in range(10):          my_list.append(i**2)      return sum(my_list)tracer = trace.Trace(count=0)tracer.runcall(my_function)result = tracer.results().get_stats()print(result)```  ",
