Saving Scatter Plots as Images#### 1. Introduction to Scatter PlotsScatter plots are useful tools for visualizing relationships between two variables. In bioinformatics, scatter plots can be used to visualize correlations between different biological features such as gene expression levels and protein structures. Scatter plots can also be used to explore patterns in large datasets, such as identifying clusters of genes associated with certain diseases.```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.random.rand(100)y = np.random.rand(100)plt.scatter(x, y)plt.show()```  ",
