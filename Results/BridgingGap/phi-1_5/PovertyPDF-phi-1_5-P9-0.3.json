Thank you!Reply 1:Inheritance allows us to define a new class based on an existing class without modifying its behavior. Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different types to respond to the same message or method call. To implement inheritance and polymorphism in your code, you need to define a parent class and child classes. The child class inherits properties and methods from the parent class while adding their own unique features. Here's an example:class Animal:      def __init__(self, name):          self.name = name      def speak(self):          passclass Dog(Animal):      def speak(self):          return \"Woof!\"class Cat(Animal):      def speak(self):          return \"Meow!\"dog = Dog(\"Fido\")cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")print(dog.speak()) # Output: Woof!print(cat.speak()) # Output: Meow!Reply 2:To implement inheritance and polymorphism in your code, you need to define a parent class  ",
