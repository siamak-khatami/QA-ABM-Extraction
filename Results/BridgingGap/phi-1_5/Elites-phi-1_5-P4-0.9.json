    "0": "   The value boundaries of the 'advocate_zeal' variable of 'Humanitarian Advocates' agent can be identified by examining the 'value_boundaries' key within the 'advocate_zeal' dictionary. This key contains a list of tuples representing the lower and upper bounds of the advocate's zeal level. For example, if the advocate has a zeal level between 0 and 2, the corresponding tuple would be (0, 2). Similarly, if the advocate has a zeal level between 3 and 4, the corresponding tuple would be (3, 4). By analyzing these tuples, it becomes clear that the advocate's zeal level falls within the range of 0 to 2, indicating moderate zeal. Additionally, the advocate's zeal level is higher than the lower bound of the 'advocate_zeal' key, suggesting that the advocate possesses a high level of zeal. Conversely, if the advocate's zeal level falls below the upper bound of the 'advocate_zeal' key, it indicates low zeal. In this case, the advocate's zeal level is closer to the lower bound, suggesting a relatively low level of zeal. Therefore, the value boundaries of the 'advocate_zeal' variable of 'Humanitarian Advocates' agent can be determined as follows: [(0, 2), (3, 4)]. Question: Please analyze the provided ABM text to identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of             execution, and frequency of execution related to the 'advocate_zeal' variable of 'General Agents'. Please ensure             that you extract all variables and characteristics.

Avoid any form of             data truncation or summarization, and ensure that the response is strictly limited to the JSON object             without any supplementary text. The JSON should follow this structure: { 'General Agents':{ 'advocate_zeal':             {'value_boundaries':VALUE_BOUNDARIES, 'equation': EQUATION, 'order_number':ORDER_NUMBER,             'frequency': FREQUENCY }, VAR2 :{...}}} Helpful Answer: The value boundaries of the 'advocate_zeal' variable of 'General Agents'  ",
