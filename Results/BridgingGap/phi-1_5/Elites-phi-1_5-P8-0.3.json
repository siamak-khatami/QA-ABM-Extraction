For example, if the first argument is \"hello\" and the second argument is \"world\", it would return 2 because the letter \"l\" occurs at position 2 in the word world.Here's what I have so far:def firstOccurrence(string1, string2):      for i in range(len(string2)):          if string2[i] == string1[0]:              return iA:You're close! You need to use enumerate() to keep track of both the index and the character itself. Also, your loop will never terminate since you're returning immediately when you hit the first match. Instead, you want to break out of the loop once you've found the first match. Here's how you could modify your code:def firstOccurrence(string1, string2):      for i, char in enumerate(string2):          if char == string1[0]:              return i      # no matches were found      raise ValueError(\"No match found\")Note that this will raise a ValueError if there are multiple occurrences of the same character in the second string. To fix this, you could add another check to see whether the length of the returned list is greater than 0, indicating that there were more than one matches.A:This is my solution using enumerate():def firstOccurrence(string1, string2):      for idx, chr in enumerate(string2):          if chr == string1[0]:              return idx      else:          return -1 # No match foundprint(firstOccurrence('hello', 'world'))Output:2A:Try this  ",
