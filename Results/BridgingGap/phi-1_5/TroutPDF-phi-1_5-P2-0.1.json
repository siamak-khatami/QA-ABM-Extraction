Introduction to subplotsSubplots are useful when you want to display multiple plots side by side in a single figure. This can be particularly helpful when comparing different datasets or visualizing relationships between variables. In Matplotlib, creating subplots is easy - simply call the `subplot()` function and pass in the desired number of rows and columns. For example, if you wanted to create a 2x2 grid of subplots, you would call `fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)`.```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)axs[0, 0].plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])axs[0, 0].set_title('Plot 1')axs[0, 1].scatter([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])axs[0, 1].set_title('Plot 2')axs[1, 0].bar([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])axs[1, 0].set_title('Plot 3')axs[1, 1].pie([1, 2, 3], labels=['A', 'B', 'C'])axs[1, 1].set_title('Plot 4')plt.show()```  ",
