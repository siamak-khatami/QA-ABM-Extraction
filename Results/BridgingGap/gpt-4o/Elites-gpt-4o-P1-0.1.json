The model is designed to test assumptions of norm diffusion theories in an environment where peer pressure is the only mechanism for punishment-based enforcement of norm adoption. It examines the role that networked elites have in diffusing a non-punishment-enforced norm through an artificial society. The model considers norm advocates who promote a norm of humanitarianism, elites who have wide networks to spread the new norm, and general individuals who evaluate the norm pushed from elites and adopted by their peers.\",\n        \"research_questions\": [\n            \"How do humanitarian norms that lack associated punishments for non-compliance diffuse across society?\",\n            \"What role do elites play in the diffusion of social norms of humanitarianism?\",\n            \"How does peer pressure influence norm adoption in the absence of formal sanctions?\"\n        ],\n        \"system_boundaries\": [\n            \"The model includes three types of agents: ordinary people, elites with social influence, and advocates who promote humanitarian norms.\",\n            \"The simulation environment allows agents to interact one-on-one and assess the norm adoption of those who are near them.\"\n        ],\n        \"outcome_variables\": {\n            \"percent_elites\": \"Percentage of population who are elites (influencers)\",\n            \"advocate_weight_e\": \"Weight advocate exerts on the elite agent\u2019s humanitarianism values\",\n            \"peer_weight_e\": \"Weight placed on interactions with other elite agents\",\n            \"network_size\": \"Randomized size of network of \u2018followers\u2019 of elites\",\n            \"advocate_weight_g\": \"Weight the advocate exerts on general agents\",\n            \"elite_weight\": \"Weight given to a networked elite\u2019s norm adoption\",\n            \"general_weight\": \"Weight given to a one-on-one interaction with a general agent\",\n            \"peer_weight_g\": \"Weight given to average humanitarian values of a group of nearby agents\",\n            \"percent_advocates\": \"Percentage of agent population who are advocates who promote a norm\",\n            \"advocate_zeal\": \"Homogeneous value given to advocate agents\u2019 humanitarianism values\",\n            \"degrade_percent\": \"Amount per time step that an agent degrades its humanitarianism values, to represent donor/compassion fatigue\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"
