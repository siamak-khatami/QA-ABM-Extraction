To begin with, let me explain how I will approach this task.Firstly, I will break down the ABM text into smaller parts, focusing on the specific section related to the 'Cells' variable. Within this section, I will identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of execution.To extract the value boundaries, I will look for the words \"range,\" \"interval,\" or \"band\" in the text, which typically indicate the bounds of a variable. For example, if the text says \"Cells range from 10 to 20,\" I will extract the value boundaries as [10, 20].For the equation, I will search for mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between the 'Cells' variable and other variables in the model. I will carefully examine the syntax and structure of these equations to ensure accuracy.To determine the order of execution, I will look for clues in the text such as \"first,\" \"second,\" or \"third\" to indicate the order in which the 'Cells' variable is evaluated. I will also check if there are any dependencies or relationships between the 'Cells' variable and other variables that might affect its evaluation order.Finally, I will extract the frequency of execution by looking for keywords such as \"each,\" \"for,\" or \"while\" that suggest repetition or iteration. I will also consider any constraints or limitations on the frequency of execution, such as \"up to\" or \"at most.\"Once I have extracted all the necessary information, I will present it in a JSON object with the following structure: {'SPACE': {'Cells': {'value_boundaries': VALUE_BOUNDARIES, 'equation': EQUATION, 'order_number': ORDER_NUMBER, 'frequency': FREQUENCY } }}.Please provide the ABM text, and I will proceed with the extraction process.
