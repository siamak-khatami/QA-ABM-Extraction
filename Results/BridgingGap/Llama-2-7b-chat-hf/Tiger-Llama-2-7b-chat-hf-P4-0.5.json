From the provided ABM text, we can extract the following information about the 'Age' variable of the 'Female Tigers' agent:{ \"Female Tigers\": { \"Age\": { \"value_boundaries\": [1, 180], \"equation\": \"age = months\", \"order_number\": 1, \"frequency\": \"monthly\" } },From the text, we can see that the 'Age' variable of the 'Female Tigers' agent takes values within the range of 1 to 180 months, with a resolution of 1 month. This means that the agent can take on any value between 1 and 180 months, inclusive.The equation associated with the 'Age' variable is simply \"age = months\", which indicates that the age of the female tiger is equal to the number of months it has lived.The order of execution for the 'Age' variable is 1, which means that it is executed once per simulation.The frequency of execution for the 'Age' variable is also \"monthly\", which means that the agent's age is updated once every month.I hope this helps!
