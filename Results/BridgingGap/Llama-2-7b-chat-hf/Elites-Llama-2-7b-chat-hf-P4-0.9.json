From the text, I understand that the value boundaries for this variable are between [0, 1]. Specifically, the text states: \"The value of the advocate_zeal variable is a homogeneous value given to advocate agents' humanitarianism values\".In terms of the equation, the text does not explicitly state an equation for the 'advocate_zeal' variable. However, it is mentioned that the value of the variable is given by \"homogeneous value given to advocate agents' humanitarianism values\". This suggests that the value of the variable is likely determined by some combination of the agent's own humanitarianism value and some other factors, such as the values of nearby agents or the agent's elite status.The order of execution for the 'advocate_zeal' variable is not explicitly stated in the text. However, since the text mentions that the variable is updated in each time step, it is reasonable to assume that the variable is updated in a sequential manner, i.e., one time step at a time.Finally, the frequency of execution for the 'advocate_zeal' variable is also not explicitly stated in the text.

    "7": "   Thank you for providing the ABM text! After analyzing the text, I can confirm that there is no direct mention of the 'advocate_zeal' variable in the provided text. However, I found some relevant information related to the 'elite-weight' variable, which could be used to estimate the value boundaries of the 'advocate_zeal' variable.According to the text, the 'elite-weight' variable represents the weight given to a networked elite's norm adoption. This variable is defined as follows:'elite-weight' = { 'value_boundaries': [0, 1], 'equation': 'weight_elite', 'order_number': 2, 'frequency': 1 }The 'weight_elite' equation is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it can be inferred from the context.

Therefore, the value boundaries of the 'advocate_zeal' variable can be estimated by examining the value boundaries of the 'elite-weight' variable.The value boundaries of the 'elite-weight' variable are [0, 1], which means that the weight assigned to a networked elite's norm adoption can range from 0 (no weight) to 1 (maximum weight). Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that the value boundaries of the 'advocate_zeal' variable are similar, i.e., the value of the 'advocate_zeal' variable can range from 0 (no zeal) to 1 (maximum zeal).Regarding the equation of the 'advocate_zeal' variable, it is not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the definition of the 'elite-weight' variable, it can be inferred that the 'advocate_zeal' variable is likely to be a linear function of the 'elite-weight' variable.
