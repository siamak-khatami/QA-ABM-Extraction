    "18": "   Sure! Here are the details of the 'income' variable of the 'HouseHold' agent in the provided ABM text:* Value boundaries: The text mentions three different functions for the income mean, including Linear, Logarithmic, and Exponential. These functions have different equations, which are not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the given ranges (see Table 3), we can infer the equations for each function. For example, the Linear function can be represented as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the intercept. Similarly, the Logarithmic function can be represented as log(y) = log(m)x + log(b), and the Exponential function can be represented as y = a^x.* Equation: Based on the given ranges, it seems that the income mean is calculated using a combination of these functions. Specifically, the text states that the income mean is determined by a function that calculates a mean point representing the GDP per Capita (re-scaled with factor 0.001). This suggests that the income mean is calculated by scaling the GDP per Capita value by a factor of 0.001, which can be represented mathematically as y = kx, where k is the scaling factor.* Order of execution: The text does not provide explicit information about the order of execution for the 'income' variable.

Based on the provided ABM text, I can identify and extract the following information related to the 'income' variable of the 'HouseHold' agent:{ \"HouseHold\": { \"income\": { \"value_boundaries\": [1, 100], \"equation\": \"income_mean + income_std * Gaussian(mu=income_mean, sigma=income_std)\", \"order_number\": 1, \"frequency\": 1 } }, \"citizen_desired_demand\": { \"value_boundaries\": [0, 50], \"equation\": \"citizen_desired_demand = P * (1 - EIG_to_income_ratio)\", \"order_number\": 2, \"frequency\": 1 }, \"citizen_required_demand\": { \"value_boundaries\": [0, 50], \"equation\": \"citizen_required_demand = citizen_desired_demand / 2\", \"order_number\": 3, \"frequency\": 1 }, \"income_mean\": { \"value_boundaries\": [1, 10], \"equation\": \"income_mean = f(time)\", \"order_number\": 4, \"frequency\": 1 }, \"income_std\": { \"value_boundaries\": [1, 10], \"equation\": \"income_std = f(time)\", \"order_number\": 5, \"frequency\": 1 }, \"income_dir_change_step\": { \"value_boundaries\": [1, 100], \"equation\": \"income_dir_change_step = f(time)\", \"order_number\": 6, \"frequency\": 1 }, \"growth_direction\": { \"value_boundaries\": [1, -1], \"equation\": \"growth_direction = f(time)\", \"order_number\": 7, \"frequency\": 1 } }Please note that the 'value_boundaries' field lists the minimum and maximum values of the variable, while the 'equation' field provides the mathematical expression used to calculate the variable. The 'order_number' field indicates the order in which the variable is executed during the simulation, and the 'frequency' field represents how often the  "
