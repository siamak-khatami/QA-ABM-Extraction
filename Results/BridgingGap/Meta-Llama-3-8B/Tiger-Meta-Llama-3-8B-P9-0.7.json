Each file has a header row containing the names ofthe fields and each row below that contains the actual data. There are 12 columns in the dataset, the \ufb01rst column beingan integer ID number that uniquely identi\ufb01es the particle and the second column being a string indicating the typeof particle. This is followed by 10 real-valued columns, one for each property of interest. The \ufb01rst seven propertiesare mass, charge, density, dielectric constant, magnetic susceptibility, temperature, and energy. The last threeproperties are length, width, height, and volume respectively. You will need to use the \ufb01rst seven properties tocalculate the last three. Your program must parse the input \ufb01les, calculate the correct values for the last threecolumns, and output them in CSV format. The program must also take command line arguments specifying theinput \ufb01le(s) to process, and an optional argument specifying the output \ufb01le(s). Output \ufb01les must be named after theinput \ufb01le(s), suffixed with \u201c_output.csv\u201d, and stored in the same directory as the corresponding input \ufb01le(s). Theprogram should report an error message when invalid arguments are given. It should also check the validity of thedata contained within the input \ufb01les. When invalid data is encountered, the program must print out an appropriateerror message. For example, an empty or blank line may result in the error message: \u201cError: Blank line detected in\ufb01le: /path/to/\ufb01lename.txt\u201d. Input \ufb01les may contain any number of rows, including zero rows. However, it mustbe guaranteed that no two particles have the same ID. The program must generate a unique ID for each particlethat does not appear in any previous input \ufb01le. Output \ufb01les should contain all the data present in the originalinput \ufb01les plus the new calculated data. Any input \ufb01le with invalid data should be ignored. Invalid data includes:\u2022 Duplicate IDs\u2022 Missing or incorrect data (e.g., negative lengths)\u2022 Empty or blank rowsYou will need to create some test \ufb01les to ensure your program works correctly.

    "3": "   The model-level variables are found within the ABM text. Within the ABM text there exists only one               model-level variable called total_population. This variable has been described within the ABM text as:              \"The total number of individuals in each simulation was determined by summing over the number of               individuals in each age class.\"                            Extracting the value boundries would require identifying where the variable is mentioned and how it's               described in relation to the other variables within the same sentence. For example, the value               boundaries for the total_population variable would be [1-180].                            The equation would be \"summed over the number of individuals in each age class\". Note that while this               could easily be written as an equation, this is not necessary because we do not need to solve               anything here - we're simply looking for a description of what the variable represents.                            There are no orders for variables within the ABM text, so I'm assuming you're referring to the order of               execution of the model. The order of execution for the model is as follows:              1) Calculate initial conditions (this includes setting up the starting values for each variable,                   including the value boundaries for total_population).              2) Determine the duration of time for which the model will run (this determines how many                   iterations of the model loop will occur). This step also sets the total number of iterations                   that will take place during the course of the entire model run.              3) Run the model loop for the specified amount of time (in this case, 20 years), performing the                   following actions at each iteration:                      * Initialize a new set of random numbers using the Random Number Generator class.                      * Loop through each individual tiger and perform its behavior calculation.                          * Each tiger performs its behavior calculation independently from other tigers.                          * Tigers may interact with other tigers when calculating their behavior.                      * Calculate the population density by dividing the number of individuals present in the                           current iteration by the total area available for occupancy.                      * Store the results of the calculations made during the current iteration in the output                           file.                      * Write out the results stored in the output file to disk.              4) End the model run once the specified duration has passed.                            The frequency of execution refers to how often the model loop executes per unit of time. Since the               model runs for 20 years, and since each iteration lasts  ",

Please identify the frequency of each           variable calculation.Helpful Answer: 6# 3.1.1FemaleTerritoryProcessThe process of acquiring territories for female tigers begins when the female reaches sexual maturity and ends when she dies (Fig. 3a). A female chooses a prey patch byrandomly selecting one of her neighboring patches (see Fig. 3b, 3c) until it meets three criteria:(1) theprey density must exceed a threshold value, (2) there must be no higher-ranking females nearby within a given distance,and (3) the female cannot be within its ownterritory boundary. Once a female selects a prey patch, she adds the patch to herterritory (Fig. 3b). When a female adds a newpatch toher territory, she calculates the new perimeterof her territorybysumming the distances between the centers ofall her patches (see Fig. 3b, 3c). As shown in Table 1, once a female has acquiredterritories, she becomes pregnant and gives birth to cubs every year (up to two cubs)untilshe dies.
