The value of the percent-elites variable changes depending on the values of the other variables in the formula. For example, if the value of the advocate_weight_g variable increases, the value of the percent-elites variable will also increase.The value of the percent-elites variable is calculated once per iteration of the simulation. This means that the value of the percent-elites variable changes every time the simulation is run, but it always has the same value within a single simulation.Question: Please analyze the provided ABM text to identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of           execution, and frequency of execution related to the 'percent-general' variable of Model-level variables.
