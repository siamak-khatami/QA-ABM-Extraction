The ABM simulation space short description is defined as \"each agent (called \u2019Household\u2019) is assigned an income level, which is determined by a function that calculates a mean point representing the GDP per Capita (re-scaled with factor 0.001). The income level is distributed using a standard deviation following the Gaussian distribution with a mean derived from the income function output (Figure 2 and Table 2). This process occurs at every tick (per year) for each agent. Given the absence of a complete market model at this stage, the simulation model relies on an external income function which emulates the market behavior. To capture stereotypical household behavior, the agents are assumed to spend their income according to the Cobb-Douglas utility function.\"  ",

    "6": "   The ABM simulation space is a virtual environment where agents interact with one another and their surroundings. It represents a simplified representation of reality, allowing researchers to explore complex systems and processes. The ABM simulation space is typically defined by a set of rules and parameters that govern how agents behave and interact within the environment. These rules and parameters may include factors such as agent characteristics, interactions between agents, and environmental conditions. By varying these parameters, researchers can investigate how changes in the environment affect agent behavior and vice versa. The ABM simulation space provides a powerful tool for exploring complex systems and understanding how they operate. By simulating various scenarios and observing the resulting behaviors, researchers can gain insights into how systems respond to different inputs and conditions. Additionally, the ABM simulation space allows researchers to test hypotheses and develop theories about how systems work. Overall, the ABM simulation space is a valuable tool for studying complex systems and gaining insight into how they operate.  ",

    "8": "   The ABM simulation environment is a virtual world where agents interact with each other and their environment. It is a computerized representation of a real-world system, such as an economy, society, or ecosystem. The environment consists of various elements, including resources, constraints, and interactions between agents. The goal of an ABM simulation is to understand how the collective behavior of agents emerges from their individual behaviors and interactions within the environment. The environment's characteristics determine the types of agents that can exist in it and the rules governing their interactions. By studying the dynamics of the environment and the agents' behaviors, researchers can gain insights into complex systems and develop strategies for managing them effectively.  ",
