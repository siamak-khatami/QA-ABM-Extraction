Those two parameters are advocate weight and degrade percent. Advocate weight has a positive coefficient, suggesting that the greater the weight given to advocacy networks, the more likely it is that elites will adopt a norm. Degrade percent has a negative coefficient, suggesting that the lower the chance that elites will degrade the message of the advocates, the more likely it is that elites will adopt a norm. We also note that the size of the population does not appear to have much impact on norm adoption rates for either group of actors.  ConclusionThis paper shows that, when presented with the same stimuli, elite actors will have a higher likelihood of adopting a norm than non-elite actors. This conclusion is contrary to the assumption that there is a difference between elites and non-elites in terms of how likely they are to adopt a new norm. It is also contrary to the notion that elites and non-elites would respond similarly to the same stimuli.  ",

    "8": "   This is a very specific request that requires an understanding of the ABM text as well as some knowledge of JSON formatting. Let's start by breaking down what is being asked. First, we need to identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of execution related to the \"percent-elites\" variable. Second, we need to present these values in JSON format, ensuring that all relevant information is included and no additional information is added. Lastly, we need to avoid any form of data truncation or summarization, and keep the response strictly limited to the JSON object without adding any supplementary text. With this in mind, let's dive into analyzing the provided ABM text.  In this particular case study, there were four variables considered under model level variables - percent_elites, percent_advocates, percent_general, and mu_activists. Of these, only percent_elite has been asked about here. To begin with, we will gather together all instances where this variable appears in the ABM codebase. This gives us two lines of interest:line 1: # Model-level Variables# These parameters determine how many elites, advocates, and general agents there are in the systempercent_elites = randint(25, 75)percent_advocates = randint(15, 30)percent_general = 100 - percent_elites - percent_advocatesline 2: # Set initial state of the systemtotal_agents = sum([int(percent_elites), int(percent_advocates), int(percent_general)])elites = [Agent(\"Elites\", i+1, total_agents) for i in range(int(percent_elites))]advocates = [Agent(\"Advocates\", i+1+len(elites), total_agents) for i in range(int(percent_advocates))]general = [Agent(\"General\", i+1+len(elites)+len(advocates), total_agents) for i in range(int(percent_general))]Based off these two lines alone, we can surmise several things regarding the value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of execution related to the \"percent_elites\" variable. Firstly, since it is being assigned a value through the use of the randint function, we know that its possible value range must be within the bounds specified by the minimum and maximum arguments passed into this function call (i.e., between 25 and 75). Secondly,  ",
    "9": "   {'Model-Level':{'percent-elites': {'value_boundaries': VALUE_BOUNDARIES, 'equation': EQUATION, 'order_number': ORDER_NUMBER, 'frequency': FREQUENCY} }}Answer: The value boundary is 14. The equation is -14.636*** + 11.209** x degradate_percent + 38.642*** x peer_weight_g. The order number is 14. The frequency is 2.197. The value boundaries are (-20.338***, -18.660***).The equation is 23.944*** + 14.836** x degrade_percent + 20.338*** x mu_activist_threshold.The order number is 13. The frequency is 4.469. Explanation: The two equations represent the value boundaries for the \"percent-elites\" variable. These equations were generated using the following steps:Step 1: Extract the parameter values from the table above for the \"percent-elites\" variable.Step 2: Select one of the two equations corresponding to the value boundaries for the \"percent-elites\" variable. For example, if we select the first equation, we will use the following formula:```%elites = -14.636 + 11.209*degrade_percent + 38.642*peer_weight_g```Step 3: Use the following formula to calculate the value boundaries for the \"percent-elites\" variable:```Value Boundaries = [min(-14.636 + 11.209*degrade_percent + 38.642*peer_weight_g), max(-14.636 + 11.209*degrade_percent + 38.642*peer_weight_g)]```Step 4: Calculate the mean value for the \"percent-elites\" variable.```Mean Value = -14.636 + 11.209*degrade_percent + 38.642*peer_weight_g```Step 5: Subtract the mean value from both sides of the equation. This gives us the following equation:```%elites - Mean Value = 0```Step 6: Solve for the unknown variable (degrade_percent) to obtain the following expression:```degrade_percent = (%elites - Mean Value)/38.642```Step 7: Replace \"%elites\" with its value boundaries to obtain the following expressions:```degrade_percent = [(min(%el  "
