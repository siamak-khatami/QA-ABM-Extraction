This is how it works:Salmon: The salmon is an ocean-dweller fish. It spawns in freshwater rivers during the fall months. After spawning, they die. They spawn in groups called schools. When they reach adulthood, they return to the river to spawn. In the summer, they migrate into the river to spawn. After spawning, they die.Brown Trout: The brown trout is a freshwater-dweller fish. It spawns in freshwater rivers during the spring months. After spawning, they die. They spawn in groups called schools. When they reach adulthood, they return to the river to spawn. In the winter, they migrate into the river to spawn. After spawning, they die.River: The river is a water body. It is made up of many streams. The stream has two main components: water depth and temperature. Water depth is measured in meters. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. The river's temperature is affected by the weather. The river's water depth is affected by rainfall. The river's temperature affects the survival of the fish. The river's water depth affects the survival of the fish. The river's temperature and water depth affect the survival of the fish.The agent set also includes the environment. The environment is the habitat of the fish.

Your task is to design and implement a program that will allow you to read temperature data from the onboard thermometer, record it, and transmit it over WiFi to your computer. You may assume that the Pi has already been connected to your home network via its built-in wireless adapter. The program must be written in Python 3.x, and you can use whatever libraries you want. However, you cannot use any external hardware devices other than the Pi's own thermometer, and you cannot use any libraries that require installing additional packages on the Pi.Your code must contain the following functions:\u2022 get_temp() - This function should return the current temperature reading from the Pi's internal thermometer.\u2022 record_temp(reading) - This function should take a single argument representing a temperature reading and store it in a file on the Pi's SD card. The file should be named after the date and time when the reading was taken, e.g. 2023-02-03_12-34.txt. Each line in the file should contain the timestamp and the corresponding temperature reading separated by a tab character.\u2022 send_temp(timestamp, reading) - This function should take two arguments: a timestamp string representing the time when the reading was taken, and a floating-point number representing the actual temperature reading. It should connect to your computer over WiFi and upload the reading to a server running on port 8080. The server should receive the request, parse the timestamp and temperature reading, and save them in a CSV file named temp_data.csv. The contents of the file should be a comma-separated list of timestamps and temperatures, one entry per line.Your code should also include a main() function that initializes the Pi's Wi-Fi connection, starts a loop that repeatedly calls get_temp(), records the result with record_temp(), and sends the reading to the server with send_temp(). The loop should continue until the user presses CTRL+C to interrupt it. After the loop finishes, the program should print out a summary report containing the average temperature recorded during the session, along with the minimum and maximum readings. Finally,  ",

Each type of agent has its own unique role in the simulation, which can be summarized as follows:Environment Agents: These agents provide the environmental conditions that affect the behavior and survival of the other agents. They serve as a static backdrop against which the dynamics of the system unfold.Organism Agents: This group includes all of the agents that represent individual members of the population being modeled. In this case, it's clear that these agents play a crucial role in determining how well the overall population survives and adapts over time. Their interactions with one another and with their environment will ultimately determine whether the species thrives or declines.Predator Agents: Predators have a very specific function in this ecosystem - they hunt down and kill other organisms, including both prey and other predators. Without them, the food chain would quickly become unbalanced, leading to either starvation among the lower trophic levels or overpopulation among the higher ones.Prey Agents: Prey animals have a much simpler role than predators do - they simply exist to be hunted down and consumed. However, their presence is essential for maintaining balance throughout the entire food web. Without them, there wouldn't be enough energy available at lower levels to support life at higher levels.External Disturbance Agents: Finally, external disturbances like floods or fires can also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of this ecosystem. While they may not directly interact with any particular organism or predator/prey relationship, their effects can ripple through the entire system and cause dramatic changes in its makeup over time  ",

    "7": "   To extract the required information, please refer to the \"Agent Sets\" section of the provided ABM    text. Each set is described on its own line and includes a brief description of the agents' role in the system.    For example, the first set has the name \"Individuals\", with the description \"Agents representing individuals\".    Similarly, the second set is named \"Trout\", with the description \"Agents representing trout\". The third set    is named \"Predators\", with the description \"Agents representing predators\".ABM Text:This article describes a simple spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) for studying the dynamics of brown trout (Salmo trutta). This model represents the population dynamics of brown trout in a small stream. It is based on empirical data collected by researchers in Switzerland. The model incorporates two predator species: trout and otters. It also takes into account the effects of temperature and water quality on the survival rate of the fish. The model can be used to study various aspects of the population dynamics of brown trout, such as the effects of different environmental conditions on the population size and composition. The model is implemented in the NetLogo simulation environment and is available online for download and use. The source code of the model is included in the appendix of this article.Model DescriptionThe IBM is designed to simulate the population dynamics of brown trout in a small stream. The model consists of three main components: the habitat, the trout, and the predators. The habitat component represents the physical environment in which the trout live. It includes factors such as water depth, water velocity, and substrate type. The trout component represents the individual fish in the population. It includes factors such as age, weight, and reproductive status. The predators component represents the other animals that prey on the trout. It includes factors such as the number of predators present and their hunting strategy.The model is initialized with a random distribution of trout in the habitat. The initial state of the system is determined by randomly selecting a value for each parameter. The model is then run for a specified number of time steps. During each time step, the model updates the state of the system based on the current values of the parameters. The model calculates the survival rate of the trout based on the current values of the parameters. The model also calculates the growth rate of the trout based on the current values of the parameters. The model then updates the state of the system based on these calculations. The model continues running until the specified number of time steps have been completed.  ",
