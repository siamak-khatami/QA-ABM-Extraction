    "6": "   {\"Model-Level\":{\"total_population\":{ \"value_boundaries\":[], \"equation\":\"\", \"order_number\":\"\", \"frequency\":\"\"}}}Explanation: As per my understanding, I will try to explain it step by step. Firstly, we need to understand what is meant by the total population. Total population means the total number of individuals present in a given area at a particular time. It includes both males and females. Secondly, we need to look at how many variables there are involved in calculating the total population. There are four main variables which affect the total population. They are age, sex, fertility rate, and mortality rate. Age plays an important role because as people grow older they tend to become less active and therefore contribute less towards increasing the overall population. Sex also matters because women usually bear children while men do not. Fertility rates vary from country to country depending upon factors like education levels, economic conditions etc. Mortality rates depend upon diseases, accidents, wars etc. Thirdly, we need to decide what kind of equation we want to use to calculate the total population. We can either use linear regression or exponential growth curves. Linear regression gives us better results when we deal with small datasets whereas exponential growth curve provides accurate estimates even though the sample size may be large. Fourthly, we need to determine the order number i.e., the sequence in which the calculations must take place. This depends entirely upon the type of equation being employed. Finally, we need to specify the frequency with which the calculation needs to occur. Again, this depends solely upon the nature of the equation being utilized. So far so good! Now let us move ahead and see how we can implement these concepts in practice. Let us suppose that we wish to estimate the total population of India during the period between 1900 AD and 2100 AD. To begin with, we need to collect relevant historical data pertaining to births, deaths, marriages, divorces, migration etc. Once we have gathered enough information, we can start working on our project. Here is one possible way of doing things: Step 1: Select the appropriate equation Depending upon the nature of the problem, we can choose either linear regression or exponential growth curve. Since we intend to work with a relatively larger dataset here, we shall opt for exponential growth curve. Step 2: Decide upon the order number Next, we need to decide upon the order number i.e., the sequence in which the calculations must take place. For instance, if we select linear regression then the order numbers would  ",

Territories are represented as sets of squares. There are two types of territories, male and female. Females are assigned a territory based on their prey availability and the presence of other females. Males are assigned a territory based on their presence and the presence of females. Each territory has a unique number. The value boundaries are between 0 and 100. The equation for calculating the total population is given as follows: total_population = sum(territories) where territories is the list of territories. The order of calculation is after the initialization step. The frequency of calculation is once per iteration.  "
