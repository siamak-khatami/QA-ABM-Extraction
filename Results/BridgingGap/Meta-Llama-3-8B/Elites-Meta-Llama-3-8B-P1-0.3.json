    "0": "       Model Purpose:         Full Description: This model simulates the spread of norms among agents in a society. It uses         heterogeneous weights to determine how much influence a single interaction has on an agent's         opinion. The model consists of three types of agents: elites, advocates, and general agents. Elites         have a fixed opinion on a norm, while advocates have a variable opinion on the norm that is         determined by their interactions with other agents. General agents have a variable opinion on the         norm that is determined by their interactions with other agents. The model also takes into account         the effect of compassion fatigue, which causes agents' opinions to degrade over time.        Research Questions:             How does the spread of norms depend on the heterogeneity of weights?             How do different types of agents affect the spread of norms?            How does compassion fatigue affect the spread of norms?Table 1: Parameter Value Ranges Table 2: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 3: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 4: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 5: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 6: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 7: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 8: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 9: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 10: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 11: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 12: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 13: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 14: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 15: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 16: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 17: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 18: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 19: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 20: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 21: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 22: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 23: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 24: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 25: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 26: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 27: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 28: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 29: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 30: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 31: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 32: Results from the Simulation Runs Table 33: Results from  ",
