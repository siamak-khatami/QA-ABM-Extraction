    "4": "   The purpose of the model is to study how norms spread through networks. It uses a simple model of humanitarianism where agents have a certain level of compassion for others. This compassion can be increased by interacting with other agents who have high levels of compassion. However, if an agent's level of compassion drops below a certain threshold, it will stop spreading compassion to others. The model also includes a mechanism for degradation of compassion due to external factors such as donor fatigue or media coverage of negative events. The research questions addressed by the model include:\u2022 How does the presence of advocates affect the spread of compassion?\u2022 How do different weights assigned to different types of interactions affect the spread of compassion?\u2022 How does the mean threshold value of all general agents affect the spread of compassion? \u2022 How does the mean humanitarianism value of all general agents affect the spread of compassion? \u2022 How does the amount of degradation per time step affect the spread of compassion? The system boundaries of the model are defined by the initial conditions and assumptions made about the world being modeled. In this case, the system consists of a population of agents who interact with each other according to specific rules. These rules define how compassion spreads within the system, and how it is affected by external factors such as degradation. The outcome variables measured by the model include the final percentage of general norm adopters and elite norm adopters. These two variables provide insight into how well the model captures reality and allows us to draw conclusions about how compassion spreads within a network.  ",

    "7": "   The purpose of the model is to study how norms spread through a population of agents. The model consists of three types of agents: elites, advocates, and general agents. Elites have high levels of humanitarianism, but do not interact directly with other agents. Advocates have moderate levels of humanitarianism, and actively promote the norm by interacting with other agents. General agents have low levels of humanitarianism, and can be influenced by interactions with other agents. The model uses the concept of social influence to determine how agents' opinions change after an interaction. Agents are connected to each other via a network, and the strength of the connection between two agents depends on their proximity. The model also takes into account the fact that agents may degrade their levels of humanitarianism over time due to factors such as donor fatigue or compassion fatigue. The model aims to answer questions related to the spread of norms in a population, such as how quickly norms spread, what factors affect the speed of spread, and whether there are any tipping points where the spread becomes rapid. The system boundaries include the initial conditions of the model, such as the number of agents, their initial levels of humanitarianism, and the network topology. The outcome variables include the final percentage of general norm adopters and elite norm adopters, as well as the mean humanitarianism level of all agents.  ",
