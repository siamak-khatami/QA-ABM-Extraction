    "5": "   {\"Households\": {\"short_description\":\"A set of agents representing individual households.\", \"agent_role\":\"Individuals who make up the society.\"}}Explanation: The text mentions the existence of two types of agents, namely Households and Firms. While the former represents individuals who make up the society, the latter refers to organizations that produce goods and services. The text further states that the households are assigned incomes based on the GDP per capita, which is calculated using a function. The standard deviation is used to distribute the income among the households, and this process takes place every year. The simulation model uses an external income function to emulate the market behavior. Furthermore, the text emphasizes that the simulation model does not include a complete market model at this stage, which means that the firms do not have access to a full range of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, options, futures, etc. Instead, they rely solely on cash flows generated from sales. The text also notes that the simulation model includes a price adjustment mechanism to maintain the equilibrium between supply and demand. Finally, the text provides a detailed description of the household behavior, including the consumption and saving decisions made by the households. Overall, the text provides a clear picture of the different types of agents present in the simulation model and their respective roles. It also outlines the key features of the simulation model, such as the use of an external income function and the lack of a complete market model.Question: Please analyze the provided ABM text to identify the list of all agent sets, a short description, and their    agent role in the system.

Each object contains two properties - `short_description` and `agent_role`. The first property provides a brief summary of what the respective agent set represents, while the second one describes its role within the larger ecosystem. By organizing the information in this way, we can easily see at a glance which entities play which roles in the simulated environment. Additionally, because all the relevant details are stored in one place, there's no risk of missing anything important during analysis or reporting.
