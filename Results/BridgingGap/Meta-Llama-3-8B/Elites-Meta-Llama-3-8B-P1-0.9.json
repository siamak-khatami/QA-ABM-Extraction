    "4": "   {'Model_Purpose': {'full_description': '''The goal of this paper is to develop an artificial agent-based model to explore the social norms of compassion and advocacy by examining how networks affect collective action for international disaster relief. This research project seeks to evaluate how people\u2019s perceptions of humanitarian actions differ based on their position in social networks. It also aims to understand why people engage in collective action or humanitarianism, depending on their role in the social network.Accordingly, there were two hypotheses tested: 1) people's decision to donate money depends more upon interactions with elites than with non-elites, while people's perception of others' decisions to help depends equally upon both. This hypothesis states that people have different thresholds when deciding to help or perceive others helping based on the source of that help and where it originates within the social network. And 2) the amount of advocacy individuals do to persuade others to act depends upon their role in the social network. Specifically, elites exert greater influence over less connected people while advocating on behalf of a cause.In order to test these hypotheses, the model simulates an artificial society divided into three main agent types. Each of these agent types has a unique interaction type, a unique value for a global variable, and a unique threshold value based on their location within the social network. These agent types include:\u2022 Advocates - these agents interact solely with other agents in the network and do not receive information from external sources; their information comes only from direct interactions with other agents in their network. They provide incentives to other agents, such as free transportation to collective meetings, and increase others' norm adoptions through these incentive mechanisms. They have higher mean values for the global variable called \u201cHumanitarianism\u201d because they have higher threshold levels than general agents.\u2022 General Agents - these agents have no special knowledge about what the ideal level of norm adoption should be; instead, they rely on feedback received from the network to determine their own behavior regarding norm adherence. They receive information from both advocates and elites, but they weigh these inputs differently depending on whether the message came from an advocate or an elite.\u2022 Elites \u2013 elites are the most knowledgeable agents in the system and have the highest mean value for \u201cHumanitarianism.\u201d They derive their opinions on norm adoption from outside sources, such as reading newspapers or attending public events related to disasters and relief efforts. They do not receive feedback directly  ",

Helpful Answer: \"The ABM's purpose is to examine how societal shifts in attitudes towards refugees evolve within a given population. While there exist many external factors affecting perceptions and behaviors, such as media outlets' influence on public opinion or economic conditions, this ABM seeks to explore the dynamics within a social network and investigate if opinions can spread through interactions amongst people. The model takes into consideration several internal drivers influencing decision-making processes. Specifically, Helpful Answer: 1. A few of the agents hold strong beliefs about a particular issue, called \"advocates\". These individuals tend to have high zeal for the cause, resulting in them actively promoting it among others. Their opinions may sway others towards adopting the norm if these advocates encounter more reluctant citizens. Advocates tend to have higher thresholds compared to other types of agents. However, when they do shift from non-believers to believers, they become extremely passionate about the topic and have very low thresholds, leading them to quickly take action. Additionally, they exert higher weights relative to other types of agents. 2. Some of the individuals are elites, which means they have more extensive networks than regular members of society but aren't  ",
    "7": "   The purpose of the model is to study and predict how norms emerge among local populations during humanitarian crises. To do this, the researcher first needs to study how agents (people) interact with each other and form their opinions about important issues such as immigration policies, refugee policy, etc. For example, in the US, we've seen how the public's views of immigration changed when Donald Trump started talking about building a wall between the US and Mexico; his influence caused people to change their minds. We can use an ABM to help us understand these phenomena because ABMs are simulations designed to reproduce reality and allow researchers to run scenarios quickly and easily. This model examines one possible way in which norms can emerge through peer-to-peer interactions. Researchers can compare the results from this scenario against empirical data gathered from the real world and see if the predictions match what happened in reality. If they do, then it might be possible to generalize the findings from this specific case into more broad insights about norm emergence dynamics.    The researcher also wants to explore whether different social network structures affect the likelihood of norm emergence among different populations. There is some evidence to suggest that certain social network structures may be more conducive to norm emergence than others - e.g., strong ties vs weak ties, homogeneous networks vs heterogeneous ones. However, there has been little work done on this topic yet so far. By running multiple simulations where different social network structures are tested, the researcher hopes to gain new insights into which factors drive norm emergence most strongly.Research QuestionsThis section will provide background information regarding the overall goal of the project, including relevant research questions. The following list identifies potential research questions that can be explored using the agent-based modeling approach outlined in the previous sections. It is worth noting that this list is non-exhaustive and serves only to demonstrate possible directions for inquiry rather than suggesting definitive answers. As such, feel free to add additional research questions beyond those listed here. Also note that not every single question must necessarily be answered within the confines of the current project, as some may require more extensive analysis outside the scope of this particular assignment. Nonetheless, attempting to address as many questions as feasible would still be desirable to achieve maximum impact towards the ultimate aim of disseminating impactful scientific knowledge through open source software development initiatives.
