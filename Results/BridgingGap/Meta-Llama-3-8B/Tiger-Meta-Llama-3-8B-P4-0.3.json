It ranges from 1 to 180 months. This variable is used to determine the age class of the female tiger, which can be either Cub, Juvenile, Transient, or Breeder. The age class determines the behavior of the female tiger, such as its ability to reproduce, hunt, and defend its territory. The age variable is updated once per month, and it follows a simple linear progression. The age variable is calculated using the formula:Age = Age + 1This means that the age increases by one unit each month. The order number of the age variable is zero because it is executed first in the process overview and scheduling section of the program. The frequency of the age variable is not specified explicitly in the program code, but it is assumed to be once per month since the age variable is updated once per month.  ",

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that ABMs can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of socialsystems such as tigers andtheir behavior patterns and movements. The model presented here providesa framework for understanding the ecological and behavioral factors driving territorialbehavior in tigers, and it may help us understand why some populationsof tigers are declining while others are stable or increasing. However, further work is neededto validate the model against empirical data and to test its ability to predict future trends in tigerpopulations.6.

It represents the age of the female tiger in months. The value boundaries for this variable are 1-180 months. There is no explicit equation associated with this variable. However, it is mentioned in the text that one month is considered as a suitable time step for tigers to establish and maintain territories. This suggests that the age of a female tiger increases by one unit each month. Therefore, we can infer that the equation for calculating the age of a female tiger is Age = Age + 1. The order number for updating this variable is 1, meaning that it is updated before any other variable. Finally, the frequency of update is monthly, indicating that the age of a female tiger is updated once per month.  "
