We must do it using the information gathered so far, and this needs to happen using Java.We'll be creating an agent-based model called \"Tiger\".This model must use a Java library called NetLogo, and this is what you should be familiar with before attempting this task. Please note that we cannot provide any help here regarding Java code, but if you wish to use some form of debugging support then feel free to reach out to us for help!The source code we'll be basing our model off of is found below:We need to implement this model by creating two files - one with all the information about how the model is constructed, and another file with all the logic inside it. The implementation details can be found here:After completing this task, please submit both your compiled binary files alongside the source code for review! Note that, due to copyright restrictions, we cannot distribute our own compilation of this program - but instead ask that you build it yourself.## SummaryTo summarize all of the work needed for this assignment, let  ",
