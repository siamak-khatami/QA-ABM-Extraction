I will provide the relevant part of the code here, along with the variables that were used in the code. The 'advocate_weight' variable controls how much influence advocates exert over other agents when interacting. It is used in two equations:1. This equation determines the value of the 'advocate_influence' variable when an advocate interacts with a general agent. The 'advocate_weight' variable is used as an input parameter:    def advocate_interaction(self):       ...        # Determine advocate's influence        self.advocate_influence =...                # Apply influence to target agent        self.target_agent.update_opinion(self.opinion, self.advocate_influence)2. This equation determines the value of the 'advocate_influence' variable when an advocate interacts with an elite agent. The 'advocate_weight' variable is used as an input parameter:    def elite_advocate_interaction(self):       ...        # Determine advocate's influence        self.advocate_influence =...                 # Apply influence to target agent        self.target_agent.update_opinion(self.opinion, self.advocate_influence)    The 'advocate_weight' variable has a default value of 0.6. Its value boundries range from 0 to 1, because the minimum value allowed is 0 and the maximum value allowed is 1. The 'advocate_weight' variable does not have a formula associated with it. Instead, it has a default value that can be modified by users. The 'advocate_weight' variable is executed once every time an advocate interacts with another agent. The 'advocate_weight' variable is referenced throughout the code, including in the following functions and methods:    * Advocate class (init(), advocate_interaction())    * Elite class (init(), elite_advocate_interaction())The 'advocate_weight' variable is referenced in the following equations:    * advocate_interaction() function    * elite_advocate_interaction() functionThe 'advocate_weight' variable is referenced in the following classes:    * Advocate class    * Elite classThe 'advocate_weight' variable is referenced in the following modules:    * agent.pyThe 'advocate_weight' variable is referenced in the following files:    * human_agents.py    * test_human_agents.pyI hope my answer provides sufficient details regarding the 'advocate  ",

This class has two methods interact and degrade_self. The former method takes the partner agent's value, updates it according to the following equation and returns the updated value. The latter method reduces the advocate agent's value by degrade_percent. The value of the advocate agent is initialized to a random uniform number between 0 and 1 and stored in self.value. Each time step, the advocate agent checks if its value is greater than zero. If so, it updates the partner agent's value using the equation and decrements its own value by degrade_percent. Otherwise, it does nothing. The partner agent is chosen randomly among the general agents present in the simulation. The value of the partner agent is stored in self.value and updated according to the equation. The value of the partner agent is also compared against the value of the advocate agent. If the partner agent's value is greater than the value of the advocate agent, no change occurs. Otherwise, the partner agent's value is reduced by degrade_percent. Note that there is no need to check if the partner agent is an advocate because all the advocate agents in the simulation have already adopted the humanitarian norm.It can be observed that the value of the advocate agent lies within the range [0, 1]. Therefore, VALUE_BOUNDARIES = [\"0\", \"1\"].The value of the advocate agent is determined by the equationvalue_{t+1} = value_{t} \u2212 degrade\\_percentwhere value_t denotes the value of the advocate agent at time t and degrade_percent is the degradation rate.
