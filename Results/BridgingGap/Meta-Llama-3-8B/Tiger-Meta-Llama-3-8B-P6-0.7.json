Further down in the paragraph, we get details about what each entity represents and its respective characteristics. We find out that the tiger entity consists of two characteristics - Age and Sex. Similarly, Habitat Cell has two characteristics - Number_of_tigers and Prey_density. Lastly, both male and female tigers have one characteristic each - Age and Sex respectively.Now, let us look at how we can encode this information into a json file using python. Firstly, we need to create a dictionary called SPACE, which will contain three sub-dictionaries named Tiger, Habitat, and Male_tiger/Female_tiger. Within these dictionaries, there'll be another level of nesting containing individual keys corresponding to each variable of interest. The key-value pairs inside these innermost dictionaries will hold relevant metadata about the variable such as short description, data type, and initial value. Finally, we'll loop through each line of input text to extract pertinent info regarding variables and store it appropriately within our final output json file.Here's some sample code illustrating how we can achieve this task step-by-step:import re # Define helper function to parse input text and extract required infodef extract_vars(input_text):    # Initialize output dict    output = {}     # Loop over each line of input text    for line in input_text.split('\\n'):        # Check if current line contains any variable-related info        match = re.search(r'\\w+: {.*}', line)                # If yes, then  ",
