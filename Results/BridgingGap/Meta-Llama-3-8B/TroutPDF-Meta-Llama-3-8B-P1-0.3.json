It includes a simple representation of prey availability, competition between individuals, and movement within the stream. The model has been developed with the goal of understanding how changes in prey availability affect the spatial distribution of trout within the stream.     Research Questions:         How does prey availability affect the spatial distribution of trout?         What is the effect of competition between trout on their spatial distribution?         How do trout move within the stream?     System Boundaries:         The system boundaries include the stream and its surrounding environment. The stream is represented as a series of pools connected by riffles. Prey availability is assumed to be constant throughout the stream. Trout are assumed to be able to swim freely within the stream.     Outcome Variables:         Spatial Distribution: This variable represents the spatial distribution of trout within the stream. It is measured as the proportion of trout found in each pool.         Prey Availability: This variable represents the amount of available prey in each pool. It is measured as the number of prey items per square meter.         Competition: This variable represents the level of competition between trout in each pool. It is measured as the average distance between neighboring trout.         Movement: This variable represents the movement of trout within the stream. It is measured as the average distance traveled by each trout over time.  ",

It includes a simple representation of the physical environment, including water velocity and temperature, and a behavioral component representing the movement of the fish within the environment. The model is intended to be used as a tool for understanding how changes in environmental conditions affect the behavior of the fish and how these changes may impact their survival and reproduction.     Research Questions:         How do changes in water velocity and temperature affect the movement patterns of the fish?         What factors influence the survival and reproduction rates of the fish under different environmental conditions?         How does the model predict the long-term effects of changing environmental conditions on the population dynamics of the fish?     System Boundaries:         The system boundaries include the physical environment, represented by the water velocity and temperature, and the behavioral component of the fish, which includes their movement patterns and interactions with other individuals.     Outcome Variables:         Survival Rate: The proportion of individuals in the population that survive over time.         Reproduction Rate: The rate at which new individuals are added to the population through reproduction.         Movement Patterns: The spatial distribution of individuals within the environment, represented by their location and direction of movement.         Population Dynamics: The changes in the size and composition of the population over time, taking into account the effects of mortality, reproduction, and migration.         Long-Term Effects: The predicted impacts of changing environmental conditions on the population dynamics of the fish over extended periods of time.   "
