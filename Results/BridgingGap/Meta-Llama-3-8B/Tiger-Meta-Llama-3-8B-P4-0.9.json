    "1": "   Hi, I'm using [Python](https://www.python.org/) as my preferred language, so here's how you can do it! 1. First, let me introduce a few objects: - `abm_text`: This is the input string containing the ABM code. - `agent_name`: The name of the agent whose variables we want to extract. - `var_name`: The name of the variable inside each agent instance. Now, we need to parse the input `abm_text` into a tree representation using a syntax-aware parser like [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org/). PEG.js uses grammars called PEGs (Parsable Expression Grammars) to describe the abstract syntax trees of programming languages. A simple example PEG for parsing Python-like expressions looks like this:```import pygments.lexers.pythonlexer = PygmentsLexer(pygments.lexers.python.PythonLexer)tree = parse_tree(lexer, 'def foo(x): return x * x')print(tree)```In this case, we're parsing a Python function expression ('def foo(x):...') using Pygments, then printing out the resulting AST. Let's use PEG.js instead so we don't depend on external libraries. Here's a simple PEG for parsing Python-style assignment statements (`x = y`):```Statement <- Assignment | Print | Return | ForAssignment <- Identifier ':' ExpressionPrint <- 'print(' Expression ')'Return <-'return' ExpressionFor <- 'for' VariableName 'in' SequenceOfExpression '{' StatementBlock '}'VariableName <- IdentifierIdentifier <- Letter {Letter | Digit}SequenceOfExpression <- Expression ',' SequenceOfExpression | ExpressionLetter <- Char Range('a-z', 'A-Z')Digit <- Char Range('0-9')Char <-!'\\n'```This parses a statement such as `'x = 42'`, returns an AST that looks like this:```[Statement] ['=', [Identifier] [Literal]]```And throws an error when faced with invalid inputs, e.g., `'foo(x)=bar'`. Now that we've defined a PEG grammar for parsing Python-like statements, we can apply it to the input ABM code using the [PEG.js parser](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/tree/master/lib/parser.js):```javascriptconst parser = new Parser(new PEGjsParser(grammar));// Parse the ABM code into a syntax-aware ASTconst ast  ",

    "5": "   Note: The 'Age' value is computed according to the following formula:        Age = (time - birth_time) / 12Where:time is the number of days since the beginning of the simulation, and birth_time is the number of days          when the age of the tiger was zero (day 0).The order of computation of the 'Age' variable follows the general rule of computation mentioned above.

These are `Value Boundaries`, `Equation` and `Order Number` and `Frequency`. I will explain each part individually.#### Value Boundaries:* 1 - 180 (months) This means that the age ranges from 1 months to 180 months.In this particular instance it is the total number of days in a year multiplied by the amount of years that have passed. So we could rewrite the values as follows:[0, 365] * [1, 480]So the lower bound would be 0 and the upper bound would be 177600 (this equates to 16 years). However this may not always be true as the values could vary. We need to consider the following cases:* If months is used then we can use the above equation i.e. [(0, 365)] * [(1, 480)]* If days are used instead of months then we can re-write the values as follows: [0, 365] * [1, 52560]* Finally if seconds are used instead of months then we can re-write the values as follows: [0, 31536000] * [1, 525599920000]Now to calculate the value boundaries we need to find out what the smallest possible value and the largest possible value for'months'.##### Months:If the value is 1 then we must assume that a single day is being represented (as opposed to 12 months). If it's greater than one then we know that it represents multiple days (e.g., 15 days = 15 * 24 hours).Assuming that we represent dates using a Unix Timestamp (seconds since January 1st, 1970) then we can determine the minimum date by simply subtracting 86400 from 1609434400 (January 1st, 2022). So the minimum date is December 31st, 1969. The maximum date is simply determined by adding 2592000 seconds to 1609434400 (January 1st, 2022). So the maximum date is December 31st, 2076.So now we have the value bounds for months.#####  ",

The 'Equation', 'Order Number', and 'Frequency' fields indicate a         possible calculation method involving integer division and modulo operations applied sequentially to         obtain the current value of the 'Age' variable.

It will take some searching through the code to find what you need. There are a lot of comments in the source files that might help you out but they may not be included in your question. If you find more useful info that isn't already in your question, feel free to include it when giving your answer, otherwise keep things as simple and clear as possible. Another helpful point would be to look for constants. These could either be hard-coded numbers inside a block of logic that determines age, or they could be input parameters in the program configuration file. This kind of information can be difficult to find because it doesn't always stick out like something written down explicitly, so consider making sure you check everywhere. A lot of models use default values for inputs, meaning that no matter what settings you put in, certain behaviors will happen exactly as if you didn't modify anything; this is usually due to bugs rather than design choices, so make sure that any input parameters actually do affect the behavior before using them as evidence. Finally, I'd recommend taking screenshots of any part of the code that's unclear about its functionality. Code sometimes looks strange when it's commented, so reading through it line-by-line while referring back to previous comments might help give context. If none of my suggestions work, ask someone else who knows more than me! Good luck!!   "
