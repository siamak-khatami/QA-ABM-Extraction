They are Tigers, Male, Female,and Offspring. Each agent type plays a specific role in the simulation. For example, Tigers are the main agents whoare responsible for carrying out various tasks like hunting, mating, etc. Male agents represent male tigers whileFemale agents represent female tigers. Similarly, Offspring agents represent offspring of female tigers while Motheragents represent mothers of female tigers. All these agent types play important roles in simulating the behavior oftigers in their natural environment.  ",
