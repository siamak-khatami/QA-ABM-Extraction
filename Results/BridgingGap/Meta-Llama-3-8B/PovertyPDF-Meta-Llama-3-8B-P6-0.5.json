    "5": "   12steps each. The reason behind this decision was that the simulations were runfor two years, and during this period, no change happened to the dynamics ofpoverty lines. We decided to use this as our baseline for the experiments. Thisdecision was made because we wanted to compare the results with those obtainedfrom the observational data, where we had 20 years worth of data. In addition,we did not want to increase the complexity of the problem by adding moreparameters. For example, if we had increased the duration of the experimentto 40 years, we would need to include more parameters such as the rate ofincrease in the income mean, and the direction of the change in the incomemean. Similarly, if we had increased the number of citizens to 500, we wouldneed to include more parameters such as the distribution of the income levelsamong the citizens. The rationale behind choosing the range of parameters isthat they reflect the typical range of values observed in real-world scenarios.For example, the income mean is typically between $30,000 and$60,000, sowe chose a range of $30,000-$60,000. Similarly, the income standard deviationis typically between 10% and 15%, so we chose a range of 10%-15%. The incomedirection change step is typically between 10% and 20%, so we chose a rangeof 10%-20%.The model was implemented using NetLogo, which is a popular platform forimplementing agent-based models. NetLogo is a free and open-source softwareplatform that allows researchers to easily implement and simulate agentbased models. It provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy tocreate and modify agent-based models. It also provides a large library of built-infunctions and procedures that can be used to create complex agent-basedmodels. NetLogo also supports parallel execution, which means that multiplesimulations can be executed simultaneously. This feature is useful when runninglarge-scale experiments, as it reduces the computational cost of executingmultiple simulations. Finally, NetLogo also supports visualization, which meansthat users can visualize their agent-based models in real-time. This feature isuseful for understanding how the model behaves and for debugging any errorsor issues in the implementation.In summary, the model was implemented using NetLogo, which is a popularplatform for implementing agent-based models.
