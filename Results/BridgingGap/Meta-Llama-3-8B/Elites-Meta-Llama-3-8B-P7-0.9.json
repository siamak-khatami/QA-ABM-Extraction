For instance, you might have something like 'mu_activist_state': {      'value_boundaries': {         'min_value': -3,         'max_value': 3     } }This allows us to know what values a variable takes during our ABM simulations. You also need to tell us how this range changes over time and what causes these changes. In the case of our example above, mu_activist_state starts at -3 and increases over time until it reaches a maximum value of 3. This increase in value occurs when the state's population increases from zero to ten. Equation The equation represents how a variable changes over time. It is important to note that equations may involve other variables which themselves will change over time. Therefore, care must be taken to correctly identify how variables interact with one another through time. For example, suppose we have two variables x and y whose relationship we want to capture using an equation. We could write this equation as follows:x = y + zwhere x, y, and z represent the values that x takes over time. So if x starts out equal to y at t = 0 then by t = 2 we would expect x to take on the value z. However, suppose instead that we had written our equation as follows:x = y \u2013 zIn this case since y and z both decrease over time while x remains constant throughout its lifetime we would see x take on negative values! This demonstrates how equations can involve multiple interacting variables. It is important therefore to carefully read your program\u2019s source code so that you understand exactly how each variable interacts with others via equations. Order of Execution To ensure that our equations are executed properly we must specify the order in which they occur within our program. In some cases there may be only one way to achieve this but sometimes more than one  ",
    "1": "   Please analyze the provided ABM text to identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of execution,and frequency of execution related to the '' variable of model space.I do not see any reference to a '' variable within the code snippet. I will attempt to extract what little information I am able to find within the ABM text sample which mentions the word \"norm\".In Figure 1, the average opinions of the two types of agents appear to converge to nearly the same value by aroundtime step 60. This means that agents\u2019 opinions have become almost identical by this point, and, since no agents\u2019opinions change during these time steps, there is no further spread of the norm between elites andgenerals.Figure 1. Time series plot of averages of norm adoption for elites and generals across simulationsFigure 2 shows that, across simulations, the convergence point becomes more extreme in favor of elites. Thismeans that the number of elites adopting a norm is higher than that of generals. The trend line suggeststhere is some variance in the final number of norm adopters among both elites and generals. Finally, itappears that, as expected, elite agents tend to adopt the norm earlier than general agents. Figure 2. Elite and General Norm Adoption Time Series PlotWe test this assumption of convergence through a t-test using the results from the simulations run on the ABM. We use the mean difference between elite and general agent average opinion to check if there are any significant differences between the two populations of agents throughout the simulation period. Table 2 shows the results of the t-tests. The first column in the table shows the t-statistic calculated according to the formula t = d - mu / s / sqrt(n), where d represents the difference between the means, mu represents the overall mean of the population, s represents the standard deviation of the two sets ofobservations being compared, and n represents the number of samples in each group. The second column shows whether we reject the null hypothesis that the two populations have equal variances, also known as heteroscedasticity, using the Levene test statistic for this. Columnthree provides us with the F statistic used to determine if the two populations are statistically different at alpha=0.05. The last columnprovides the p-value associated with rejecting the null hypothesis that the two populations are homogenous, i.e., that the difference is zero. As we can see  ",
