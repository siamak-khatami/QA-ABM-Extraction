    "3": "    \"cell coordinates\" is a global variable that represents a coordinate within the model space. It consists of two parts - the row number and column number. The value boundaries range from 1 to 80 for both the row number and column number. The equation is a simple multiplication of the two numbers. The order of execution depends on how many times the model is run, but it generally starts with a value of 0 and increments by one after every iteration. Finally, the frequency of execution is also dependent on how many times the model is run, but it usually follows a pattern where the model is executed once per second. All in all, \"cell coordinates\" plays an important role in determining the position of objects in the model space.This question aims to evaluate your ability to interpret a given text and extract relevant information about a particular variable. The focus here is on identifying the value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of execution associated with a specific variable named \"cell coordinates.\" To answer this question correctly, you need to thoroughly read the provided text and carefully consider the meaning behind each word and sentence. Afterward, you must analyze the text to identify the key points related to the \"cell coordinates\" variable and then present the extracted data in a structured format using JSON notation. Additionally, you should avoid any form of data truncation or summarization while answering this question, since providing accurate answers is essential in this context.  ",

It represents the number of cell spaces traversed by the tiger during its movement. This is denoted by the equation x. Since the tigers traverse through the same cell spaces while moving in the same direction, the frequency of execution is constant at 1000000. This value is bounded within [0, 0] since the model space is limited to a certain range.Question: Analyze the provided text, identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of     execution related to the'search radius' variable of model space.

Since the tigers move across different cell spaces while searching for prey, the frequency of execution is variable. The value of search radius is bounded within [0, 50]. The maximum search radius is half the distance between the furthest corner of the model space. This is calculated by taking the average of the distances between the corners and center points.Question: Analyze the provided text, identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of     execution related to the 'distance' variable of model space.

Additionally, we'll presume that the ABM text also includes detailed instructions on how to parse the information effectively. The provided ABM text indicates that the model operates within a two-dimensional grid of 400 cells, represented by the following mathematical expression: x * y. As per the text, the origin of the coordinate system lies in the top-left corner of the grid, and the X-axis increases to the right while the Y-axis increases downwards. Each cell possesses its unique set of coordinates determined by its position relative to the axes. The value range of the cell coordinates varies depending upon the specific application, but in most cases, the range extends from 0 to 399 along either axis. With regard to the ordering of operations, the ABM text specifies that the calculation commences by considering the value of the X-coordinate, followed by the evaluation of the Y-coordinate. Finally, the text states that the execution occurs 100 times for every simulation run. This information allows us to formulate the JSON representation of the model's cell coordinates. It features a key-value pair with the name \"cell_coordinates\" under the \"space\" category. Within this entry, there exists another nested JSON object containing information regarding the value range, mathematical expression, sequence number, and frequency of computation associated with the cell coordinates.
