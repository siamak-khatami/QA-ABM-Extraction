Income represents the amount of money available to a household for spending on goods and services. Consumption refers to the quantity of goods purchased by a household, reflecting its demand for goods. Price denotes the cost of goods set by the market, influenced by supply and demand. Finally, poverty level indicates the degree of hardship faced by a household due to insufficient income. These attributes play a critical role in shaping the overall economic landscape  "
