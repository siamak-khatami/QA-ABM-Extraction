Each of the value boundary arrays represents one set of     coordinates. The order number array represents the order sequence for executing those coordinates, while     the frequency array represents the total frequency of executing each coordinate during simulation.Value BoundariesThe first row of value boundaries represents the location of upper right corner coordinate of the map, while     the second row shows the location of bottom left coordinate of the map. The coordinates are expressed as     x,y pairs in a two-dimensional grid. Both x and y are negative numbers in the first two rows because the    coordinate system starts from (-5, -5) in the upper-left-hand corner of the map, with positive numbers     being located towards the lower right corner. In the last two rows, both x and y coordinates start with     zero as the origin for mapping.EquationsIn this section, we provide the equations required to determine the locations of each of the four points     represented in the Value Boundaries section. Each equation includes either a single constant or a variable.    Variables include x and y, which respectively represent the horizontal and vertical position of the     coordinate point. Depending upon the desired outcome, we can modify these equations by changing their     constants or substituting different variables for them.Order NumberThis section provides a matrix representing the execution order of each of the value boundaries. For     example, [0,0] indicates that the first point of value boundaries must be executed first, followed by     the second point of value boundaries, and so forth. This sequence follows a top-down, left-to-right pattern,    where the topmost value boundary row is scanned horizontally before scanning down to the next row. Thus,     if we were given a new value  ",

    "4": "   [{'SPACE':{'cell coordinates': {'value_boundaries': [1, 40], 'equation': '(x + y) / 2', 'order_number':'first order', 'frequency': 'once per run'}}Explanation: The value boundaries are set by the code in lines 17-20:int xc = x - (width / 2); int yc = y - (height / 2);xc += width * xoff; yc += height * yoff;These equations produce a coordinate pair which shifts the origin to the top left corner rather than the bottom right corner. Then, it multiplies the two coordinates by scaling factors determined by the code in line 21 and 22:float xoff = poff - 0.5f; float yoff = poff - 0.5f;This ensures that the point lies within the cell defined by the original row and column number.

    "5": "   This section describes the mathematical rules that govern how a specific variable in the model evolves andchanges over time. Note that this is done after describing how initial conditions affect the system; here we are looking athow internal factors affect its evolution. It also specifies whether the variable's rate of change is constant or variable(i.e., proportional to another quantity). \"The rate of growth/decay depends on a function, X = f(Y).\" Such a rule must holdat every point in the system. If the rule does not specify an exact value for the derivative but gives a range within whichit varies, or only a few points where it takes a particular value, this may be specified as a bound or interval. Rules mayalso vary over time or location, so this must be speci\ufb01ed. Some equations describe discrete quantities changing one unitat a time. If a variable undergoes a signi\ufb01cant transformation or changes abruptly according to some criteria, the modelmay simply specify a new value for the variable. This may be written as an algorithm or code snippet that provides thenew value based on the previous value and current state, as well as other inputs like temperature, season, etc. Thespecification must include enough details for someone skilled in writing computer programs to write an implementationthat exactly follows the described algorithm.Helpful Answer: This section describes how the various entities interact with each other, usually specifying the effects thatone entity has on others. Here again, the interaction may occur via a function, X = f(Y), or some other relationship, e.g.,X \u2192 Y, or X \u2194 Y. In general, many things can affect each other. When multiple variables interact simultaneously, theoutcome may depend nonlinearly on each of the variables. This effect may be due to multiple variables acting concurrently,such as when a predator consumes multiple prey. Often, many different variables work together in a way that cannot bereduced to simpler interactions among smaller sets of variables. It may be useful to provide a graphical depiction of howvariables influence each other, since this makes it easier to verify the consistency of the equations. A detailed explanationof what happens under each circumstance is usually given in this part.
