The scenario should be        composed of the input values and output responses specified below. Describe how you built the         simulation scenario to ensure that your answer will accurately help other programmers to         replicate and test our scenarios. Avoid unnecessary technical details and focus primarily on         explaining the thought process behind the simulation scenario construction, i.e. present a         high-level overview of the procedure, not low-level code snippets.      Scenario Input:         - Agents (General Norm Followers, General Norm Adopters, Elite Norm Adapters)        - Number of Elite Norm Adapters = 250        - Number of General Norm Followers = 3000        - Number of General Norm Adopters = 5000    - Simulation Runtime = 20 weeks    - Time Step = 1 week    - Interaction Type = Face-to-face    - Interaction Frequency = Once per time step    - Probability of Interacting with an Elite Norm Adapter = 80%    - Probability of Interacting with a General Norm Follower = 60%     - Probability of Interacting with a General Norm Adopter = 40%Scenario Output:      - At the end of the scenario, what percentage of agents would have adopted the norm?Helpful Answer:Explanation: Firstly I\u2019ll explain how I selected my input values above. According to the problem statement, I decided that since there were no fixed constraints defined regarding agent numbers, I would instead choose values that represent extreme cases, to explore the range of possible outcomes. Hence, I chose 250 elite norm adapters, which represents the smallest number, and 5000 general norm followers and 3000 general norm adopters, representing the largest possible number. This resulted in a total of 7500 agents in the population. Secondly, I chose 20 weeks as runtime, since I wanted to keep things simple but allow the outcome to vary sufficiently. However, if I had more time available to me, I could probably experiment with higher runtimes like 50 or even 100 weeks, though obviously depending on resources such as processing power etc.Next comes the tricky part, deciding what exactly constitutes an acceptable interaction frequency and probability distribution between different types of actors. On one hand, since we\u2019re dealing with very small numbers here compared to  ",

Question: Using the provided ABM text, please provide your own explanation for the Space        short description and Type used in the ABM. Explain why that particular short description and      Type was chosen. Ensure that your explanation covers exactly these two points. Also include   additional ABM specific details or examples where appropriate. Your answer may be presented  as a short paragraph.Explanation: This example involves the use of several methods such as the ABM method which can be applied to any system or environment including humans, animals, organizations, etc. In this case the ABM method will be applied to both the elites and the general public to show how people behave in certain situations. The term \u201cgeneral\u201d refers to those who do not hold positions of power within society while \u201celite\u201d refers to those who occupy higher ranks than others in terms of status and authority. For instance someone holding a high position like a CEO, President, King, etc.. would fall into the category of Elite while everyone else falls under the umbrella term of General Public. These two categories represent the main actors involved in this simulation game i.e. the one controlling resources vs. those being controlled by them. Here, we consider ourselves as part of this larger group called humanity but due to differences among us depending upon various factors including geography, religion, culture, language, history, family background, political beliefs, etc., there exist several subgroups too. Some subgroups have managed to gain more privileges compared to other less fortunate ones. This difference creates tension amongst members belonging to both sides leading either way towards conflict resolution by adopting new standards related to morality  ",

Its type is rectangular which means that it will have boundaries that are defined by two vertical axes named 'x' and two horizontal axes named 'y'. These axes have their own increments which define how much the coordinates may change when updating them. These increments are 20 units of 'x' and 50 units of 'y'. The initial coordinates for these spaces are defined on line #39. They are initialized to be x=300 and y=250, so the top-left corner coordinate is x,y = (300,250).The total number of iterations in this space (total number of time steps) is defined by line #43 where it is defined as being equal to thirty (30).Finally, there are several constraints that determine what the minimum requirements are for the time step durations. Line #46 states that there must be at least forty (40) time steps, line #47 states that each iteration must take no less than five seconds (5). Lines #49 and #51 state that the time step durations cannot go below 100 milliseconds or exceed 10 seconds respectively.  ",
