So, we can probably assume the following range for it:(percent_adopters_range, percent_adopters_value)So, when `percent_adopters` is equal to `percent_adopters_value`, the effect of `Nearby_adopters_threshold` will be equal to `percent_adopters_value`.To summarize the list of extracted variables, I would suggest something like:{\"Humanitarian Advocates\":{\"weight_general\":[0,1],\"weight_elite\":[0,1],\"weight_peer\":[0,1],\"advocate_zeal\":[0,1],\"percent_nearby_adopters\":[0,1], \"percent_nearby_adopters_threshold\":(0,1)}}Note: I'm assuming that the default initial values of most of the variables are 0. But please let me know if you want me to provide additional explanations for the values themselves, along with the reasons behind choosing the range. Thanks!  "
