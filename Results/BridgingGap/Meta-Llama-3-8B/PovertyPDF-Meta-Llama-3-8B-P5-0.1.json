    "1": "   The ABM simulation space is a virtual environment where agents interact with one another and their surroundings. It represents the world in which the simulation takes place, and it is crucial to understand how the space affects the behavior of the agents within it. In this case, the ABM simulation space is a virtual representation of the global economy, where agents represent individual households. The space is characterized by a high degree of abstraction, with no physical boundaries or limitations. Instead, the space is defined by the interactions between agents and the rules governing those interactions. The space is dynamic, changing over time as agents respond to changes in their environment.
