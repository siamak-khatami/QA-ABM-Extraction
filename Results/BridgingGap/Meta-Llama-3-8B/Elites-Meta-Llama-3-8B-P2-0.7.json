    "2": "   The provided ABM text consists of two agent sets, namely Advocate Agents and General Agents.Both these agent sets play a critical role in the simulation as the simulation's output depends entirely upon the outcome of their respective interactions. Both the agent sets perform differently according to their characteristics like Advocate Weight and Elite Weight, respectively. For instance, Advocate Agents tend to exert more influence over the General Agents than Elite Agents due to their higher Advocate Weight. On the other hand, Elite Agents exert less influence over General Agents than Advocate Agents owing to their lower Elite Weight. However, both agent sets play significant roles in determining the final percentage of general norm adopters and elite norm adopters. Thus, both these agent sets must be considered while analyzing the provided ABM text. Therefore, the list of all agent sets can be represented as follows: { 'Advocate Agents': {'Short Description': 'Agents promoting a norm','Agent Role': 'Promote Norm Adoption'},'General Agents':{'Short Description':'Heterogenous agents influenced by others','Agent Role': 'Norm Adopters'}} Table 1: Parameter values used in Latin Hypercube design Parameter Value Range advocate-weight [0.05, 0.95]elite-weight [0.01, 0.99]general-weight [0.01, 0.99]peer_weight_g [0.01, 0.99]percent-advocates [0.25, 0.75]advocate-zeal [0.25, 0.75]degrade-percent [0.01, 0.99]mu-activist-state [0.001, 0.999]mu-activist-threshold [0.001, 0.999]population [500, 1000]Helpful Answer:The provided ABM text provides a detailed description of the model's simulation process. According to the ABM text, there are several steps involved in simulating the model. These steps are described below:1. Define Parameters: This step involves defining all relevant parameters such as Advocate Weight, Elite Weight, etc., which will affect the behavior of the model during simulation.2. Initialize Environment: In this step, we initialize the environment where the simulation takes place. We set certain initial conditions like population size, number of agents present initially, etc.3  ",

We ran a linear regression model on the dependent variable (final percentage of general norm adopters) and the independent variables. We included only those variables that had p-values < 0.05, and excluded those that did not. This resulted in a model that included only mu-activist-thrshld and degrade-percent as statistically significant variables. From the significant variables, we can conclude that the more extreme the activist threshold values, the lower the percentage of norm adopters. We can also see that higher levels of compassion fatigue correlate with fewer norm adopters. The full regression equation  ",

If there are multiple groups of agents nearby, the agent uses the average opinion of those agents as its peer influence value. At the end of every time step, all agents degrade their values by a percentage determined by the degrading rate and the percentage of norm adopters.  To understand how these systems work, it is important to consider the role of the agents within the model. There are three types of agents in this model: general agents, advocates, and elites. General agents are members of society who can be persuaded to adopt a norm based on their perception of their peers\u2019 behavior. In this case, the norm is a commitment to aid refugees arriving from Europe. Advocates are highly socially connected individuals who seek to persuade elites to adopt the humanitarian norm. Elites are politically connected individuals who can be persuaded to adopt the norm based on their perception of their peers\u2019 behavior.  # Answer 11## Question: You are considering designing a new software application that will run on mobile devices, and will serve as a tool for employees of a company to report various issues such as problems with hardware, broken equipment, etc. This app will use GPS coordinates to determine the location of the reported problem.
