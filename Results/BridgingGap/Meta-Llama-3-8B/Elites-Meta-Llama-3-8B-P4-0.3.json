    "5": "   The value boundaries for the advocate zeal variable are between 0 and 1. The equation is as follows:advocate_zeal = 1 - degrade_percent * t / 100Where t is the current timestep and degrade_percent is a global variable representing the amount by which an agent's humanitarianism values degrade over time. This degradation represents donor/compassion fatigue. The order number is 3 because it is calculated after the degrade_percent variable has been updated. Finally, the frequency is every timestep.  ",
