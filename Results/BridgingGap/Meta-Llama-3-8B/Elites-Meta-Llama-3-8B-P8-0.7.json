    "2": "   Here is the answer:# List of Model-Level Variables:## 1. Elite Network SizeThe elite network size is a measure of how many other people a particular individual knows within their social circle. It is calculated by counting the total number of individuals connected through shared relationships, such as colleagues or friends. This value will range from 0 to infinity depending upon whether there exists any connections between individuals.## 2. Number Of FriendsThis represents the number of direct connections made between two people within the same social group. These connections could exist either online via social media platforms or offline face-to-face meetings. The count starts at zero when no links have been established yet.## 3. Degree Of SeparationIn social networks, degree of separation refers to the minimum number of hops required to reach another node from a given source node. For instance, if Alice is directly linked to Bob but does not know Charlie directly, then she needs two degrees of separation to reach him since she has to traverse one edge connecting her to Bob first before reaching Charlie. The maximum possible degree of separation here would be n \u2013 1 where n is the size of the network under consideration.## 4. Average Path LengthAverage path length refers to the mean distance traveled along edges between pairs of nodes in a graph. Mathematically speaking, it can be expressed as follows:where d(x,y) denotes the shortest path distance separating vertices x and y respectively. Note that this formula assumes undirected graphs; however, weighted versions exist too!## 5. DiameterDiameter measures the longest pairwise distance amongst all vertices present in a graph. Formally speaking, diameter equals max d(v,w), where v and w represent arbitrary vertices belonging to the same graph G=(V,E).## 6. Transitivity IndexTransitivity index provides insight into how closely related neighboring groups tend to interact with each other compared to random pairs drawn randomly out of the entire dataset. A high transitivity score indicates strong clustering patterns among subgroups while low scores suggest sparse interconnections across diverse populations.## 7. Clustering CoefficientClustering coefficient indicates the likelihood of finding clusters within local neighborhoods. Specifically, given a vertex u, its clustering coefficient C(u) is defined as the ratio between the number of triangles containing u divided by the total number of triangles in the entire graph. Triangles refer to triples consisting solely of unique elements. So if we consider a simple undirected graph having only three vertices namely {u,v,w}, then the corresponding triangle would  ",

Norm emergence is described as the process where a minority group of individuals with similar beliefs convince a majority group of people to change their opinion about something so that it becomes the new norm. This process has been studied extensively in the context of innovation diffusion and product adoption but there is little research done in the context of humanitarian norms. The authors have designed an agent-based model to understand this process better and test some of the existing theories about how norms are adopted. They argue that existing models do not capture enough detail to explain the dynamics behind norm emergence and therefore they present a more detailed model than previously proposed.  ",
