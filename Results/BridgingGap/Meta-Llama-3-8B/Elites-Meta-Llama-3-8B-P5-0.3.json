MAS models are often used to simulate complex systems involving multiple interacting agents. One such system is the diffusion of norms, which refers to the process by which new ideas or behaviors become widely accepted within a population. In this paper, we present a novel approach to simulating norm diffusion using a MAS framework. Our model consists of two types of agents: elites and general agents. Elites are characterized by high levels of education, income, and political influence, while general agents have low levels of these characteristics. Both types of agents interact with one another, but elites tend to have more influence over general agents than vice versa.
