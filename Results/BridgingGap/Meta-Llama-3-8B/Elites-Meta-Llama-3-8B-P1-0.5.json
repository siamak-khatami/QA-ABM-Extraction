It aims to investigate the effect of varying degrees of altruistic tendencies, peer influence, and socialization on the emergence of a new social norm. Specifically, it seeks to examine whether the existence of such norms can be attributed to individual characteristics, collective dynamics, or both. Additionally, the model aims to explore the role of external influences, such as media coverage and government policies, in shaping social norms. Finally, it attempts to evaluate the impact of these factors on the sustainability of newly established norms.  ",

    "4": "   The purpose of the model is to examine how norms can spread through networks of people. The authors are interested in understanding how advocacy can affect the spread of norms. They believe that norms spread through social networks, and that individuals may change their opinions about a norm based on what other people think. In particular, they want to understand how advocates influence the spread of norms. Advocates are people who are very passionate about a cause, and they often work to convince others to support the same cause. The researchers believe that advocates can be very effective at spreading norms, but they also recognize that there are limits to what advocates can do. They want to understand when advocates will be successful at spreading norms, and when they will fail. They use an agent-based model to explore these questions. An agent-based model is a type of model that simulates the behavior of individual agents in a system. In this case, the agents are people, and the system is a social network. The researchers create a virtual world where agents interact with each other, and they track how the norms spread through the network. By doing this, they hope to gain a better understanding of how advocacy affects the spread of norms. In terms of research questions, the authors are interested in asking whether advocacy has a positive or negative impact on the spread of norms. They are also interested in exploring how the effectiveness of advocacy depends on factors such as the size of the network, the density of connections between nodes, and the number of advocates present. Finally, they would like to investigate how different types of nodes (e.g., those with high degrees of centrality vs. low degrees of centrality) respond differently to advocacy efforts. In terms of system boundaries, the model only considers two types of nodes: advocates and non-advocates. All nodes have equal access to information, and all nodes are equally likely to become advocates. The outcome variables include measures of how quickly norms spread through the network, how many advocates there are, and how many non-advocates there are. {'Model_Purpose': {'full_description':'The purpose of the model is to examine how norms can spread through networks of people.

    "6": "   The purpose of this model is to explore the spread of norms among populations. This can be done by modeling the spread of a norm within a society, where the norm might be something like a new style of clothing, a new way of talking, etc. The model will also allow us to see how quickly a norm spreads through a population, and what factors affect this process.In order to do so, we need to define some key concepts:* A population consists of individuals who interact with each other according to certain rules. These rules determine how fast a norm spreads through a population.* A norm is something that everyone agrees upon; it could be anything from wearing a specific type of clothes to speaking a particular language.* An individual has a certain level of agreement with the norm; this determines whether he/she adopts it or not.Now let's look at some examples:Example 1: Let's consider a situation where there are two types of people - those who wear jeans and those who wear skirts. We'll call these two groups \"jeans\" and \"skirts\", respectively. In our model, we assume that every person belongs either to the jeans group or the skirt group. Now suppose that initially only half of all people belong to the jeans group while the other half belongs to the skirt group. Then after some time, more and more people start wearing jeans instead of skirts. This happens because when someone sees another person wearing jeans, he/she gets influenced by him/her and starts wearing jeans himself/herself. Similarly, if someone sees another person wearing skirts, he/she too may get influenced and start wearing skirts. So gradually, more and more people begin wearing jeans until eventually everyone wears them! Thus, even though initially there were equal numbers of both kinds of people, eventually everyone ends up wearing jeans!Example 2: Consider another scenario wherein everyone speaks English except one person who speaks French. Initially, everyone agrees upon English being spoken everywhere but gradually, as more people learn French and start speaking it, others also start learning French and soon everybody speaks French! Again, although initially there were fewer French speakers than English ones, eventually everyone spoke French!Now let's summarize what we've learned so far:1. Populations consist of individuals who interact with each other according to certain rules. These rules determine how fast a norm spreads through a population.2. A norm is something that everyone agrees upon; it could be anything from wearing a specific type of clothes to speaking a particular language.3. An individual has a certain level of agreement  ",
