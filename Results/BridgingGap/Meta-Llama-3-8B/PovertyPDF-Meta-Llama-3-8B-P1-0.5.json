    "2": "   This model aims to explore how economic policies affect the dynamics of poverty lines. It uses agent-based modeling (ABM) as a tool to simulate the behavior of individuals in a society. Specifically, the model focuses on exploring the relationship between disposable income, consumption patterns, and poverty levels. By varying the parameters related to income distribution and consumption habits, the model seeks to understand how changes in these factors impact the prevalence of poverty in a simulated population. The research questions addressed by this model include understanding the impact of income inequality on poverty rates, investigating the role of government subsidies and taxes in reducing poverty, and evaluating the effectiveness of various social welfare programs in alleviating poverty. The system boundaries of this model encompass the interactions between individual agents (representing households) and their environment, including other agents and external forces such as government policies. The outcome variables tracked by the model include measures of poverty incidence, income distribution, and consumption patterns. These outcomes provide insights into the efficacy of different economic policies and inform decision-making processes aimed at reducing poverty.Question: What are the purposes of the model?

To achieve this goal, the model tracks various indicators related to poverty incidence, income distribution, and consumption patterns.

    "3": "       This agent-based model aims to explore the dynamics of poverty lines by simulating a population's economic behavior. The model uses a discrete-time framework where each tick represents one year, and agents' decisions are made according to their preferences and constraints. The model consists of three main components:     (1) Agents: Individuals who represent real-life people in society. They have certain characteristics such as age, gender, income level, etc.     (2) Environment: A virtual world where agents interact with each other and their environment. It includes factors like inflation rate, interest rates, government policies, etc.     (3) Rules: Regulations governing how agents behave and interact with each other and their environment. These rules determine what actions agents take based on their circumstances and goals.     The model seeks to address two research questions related to poverty lines:     (1) How does poverty change over time given different economic conditions?     (2) What factors contribute to changes in poverty levels?     To answer these questions, the model analyzes several variables including disposable income, consumption patterns, savings habits, etc. The system boundaries include the population being studied, the economy they live in, and external influences like government policies or natural disasters.     The outcome variables analyzed by the model include poverty headcount ratio, Gini coefficient, and Lorenz curve. These measures help assess the distribution of wealth within the population and provide insights into potential causes of poverty. \"\"\"import jsonimport redef extract_data(text):    # Extract the model purpose    purpose = re.search(r\"Please analyze the provided ABM text to identify the purpose of the model\\.\", text).group()        # Extract the research questions    questions = re.findall(r\"RESEARCH_QUESTION_[0-9]+\", text)        # Extract the system boundaries    boundaries = re.findall(r\"\\[BOUNDARY_[0-9]+\\]\", text)        # Extract the outcome variables    variables = re.findall(r\"VAR[0-9]+_NAME\\s*:\\s*(.*?)\\.\\s*\", text)        return {        \"Model_Purpose\": {\"full_description\": purpose, \"research_questions\": questions, \"system_boundaries\": boundaries, \"outcome_variables\": dict(zip(variables, [\"SHORT DESCRIPTION\"] * len(variables)))}    }if __name__ == \"__main__\":    # Replace the input text with your own sample text    input_text = \"\"\"    Question: Please analyze the  ",
