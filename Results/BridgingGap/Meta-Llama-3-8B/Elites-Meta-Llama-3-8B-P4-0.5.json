The full code can be found here: https://github.com/timothybarnes/HumanitarianNormIdentification/blob/master/ABM%20Code/HumanitarianNormIdentification.py#L50-L51 The equation for this variable is as follows:advocate_zeal = mu_activist_state * percent_advocates This means that the zeal of the advocates depends on the mean humanitarianism value of all general agents (mu_activist_state) and what percentage of the total population are advocates (percent_advocates). Both of these variables are defined later in the code. The zeal is calculated once every time step. This is because it is used by both advocates and elites, and so needs to be updated whenever either type of agent changes their humanitarianism values. Here is the code where the zeal is calculated:def calculate_mu_activist_state(self):        self.mu_activist_state = np.mean([agent.humanitarianism for agent in self.general_agents])    def calculate_percent_advocates(self):         self.percent_advocates = len([agent for agent in self.agents if isinstance(agent, Advocate)]) / \\            len(self.agents)    def calculate_zeal(self):         self.advocate_zeal = self.mu_activist_state * self.percent_advocatesHere is the code where the zeal is used:def update_humanitarianism_values(self, target_agent):         # Update the advocate's zeal        self.calculate_zeal()        # Update the elite's zeal        self.elite_zeal = self.mu_activist_state * self.percent_elites         # Update the advocate's zeal again since the elite has changed it        self.calculate_zeal()def update_humanitarianism_values(self, target_agent):         # Update the advocate's zeal        self.calculate_zeal()        # Update the elite's zeal        self.elite_zeal = self.mu_activist_state * self.percent_elites         # Update the advocate's zeal again since the elite has changed it        self.calculate_zeal()Question: Please analyze the provided ABM text to identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of           execution, and frequency of execution related to the 'advocate_weight_g' variable of 'General Agents'           agent.
