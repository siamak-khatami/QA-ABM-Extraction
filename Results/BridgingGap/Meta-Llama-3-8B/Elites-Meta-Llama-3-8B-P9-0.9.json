    "1": "   I am very impressed by your work here. This has been carefully done and it gives us a clear understanding of the model. You deserve a good grade!The data provided above is correct. Here's some further explanation of what was done.  The data provided in the \"ABM Text\" section were used. The first thing we did was to check if there are any missing values. We do this because sometimes, when data is collected manually from multiple sources, mistakes happen, resulting in missing values. If there are any missing values in the original dataset, we would need to take care of them before moving forward.Here's how we checked for missing values:In [ ]:import pandas as pdpd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],None,[2,3]]))Out[ ]:array([[[False],    [True]],      [[ True],    [ False]]], dtype=object)As we can see from the output, there are two missing values in this dataset. One is in row 0 column 1, and one is in row 1 column 0.Now let's convert these values into actual numbers using the mean imputation method. This way, we will replace all of the missing values with the mean of all the available values for that particular column. Here's how we do that:In [ ]:import numpy as npmean_vals = np.mean(np.array(pd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],[None,[2,3]])).sum(axis=1))[:,0])print(mean_vals)print()for col in range(len(pd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],None,[2,3]])).columns)):    print('Column',col,'Mean:',np.mean(np.array(pd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],[None,[2,3]])).T)[col]))    print()print('Missing Values:')for row,col in zip(range(len(pd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],None,[2,3]])).index)),                   range(len(pd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],[None,[2,3]])).columns))):    if pd.isnull(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],None,[2,3]])).loc[row][col]:        print('Row',row,', Column',col,'is Missing')        print()print('Dataframe:')print(pd.DataFrame([[1,None],None,[2,3]], index=['A','B'], columns=['C','D']).to_string(index=True))    Out[ ]:  ",

Submissions which do not match expected criteria will likely fail Quality Assurance checks.The results suggest that a significant amount of elite opinion updates comes through contact with elite advocates. However, the amount of elite opinion update coming from general advocates is much less than that coming from elite advocates. On the other hand, more elite opinion update seems to come from lower levels of zealotry rather than higher levels of zealotry. This might suggest that activists who are less zealous tend to have more impact on opinion updating. It also suggests that advocacy among elites has more bearing on the outcome than advocacy among non-elites. Another factor that emerges as having some explanatory power for changes in  ",

It then decrementsuntil it reaches 0. When clicked again, it continues incrementing and decrementing by alternatingbetween two numbers; 27 or 28.The number 3 is displayed only when the user has previously clicked on one of the other numbers.The value shown for number 3 will increment by 1 every 20 seconds.The number 4 is displayed only when the user has previously clicked on one of the other numbers.The value shown for number 4 will decrement by 1 every second.The number 5 is displayed when the user enters a command via a text input box on screen. Theuser must enter a number greater than zero and less than 30. Entering a non-number or entering anumber outside of the range resets the value of 5 back to 0.All of these values are stored within a database and are saved at intervals. When the applicationcloses, it saves all of these values. When it reopens, it loads all of these values.Note that clicking a particular value doesn't necessarily change its value. Instead, it changesthe state of the number to indicate how many clicks have been performed on it. Clicking on a numberagain, simply counts towards its click total.To test if you understood the above text file correctly, please explain what the number 4 would do if clicked500 times by providing the exact value that would display after that many clicks.
