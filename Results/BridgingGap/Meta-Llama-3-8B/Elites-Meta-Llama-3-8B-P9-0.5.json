It is equal to:(percent-elites) = (mean_elite_opinion / mean_general_opinion) * (# of generals)The order number represents the position of the percent-elites variable within the list of variables executed during each iteration of the simulation. In this case, it is executed after the calculation of the mean_elite_opinion and mean_general_opinion variables, and before the calculation of the total number of elites.Finally, the frequency indicates how often the calculation is performed during each iteration of the simulation. In this case, it is performed once per iteration, since it is calculated only when the simulation starts or resets.Overall, the extracted data consists of four key elements: the value boundaries, the equation, the order number, and the frequency.
