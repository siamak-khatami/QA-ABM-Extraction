These include the mean state of humanitarianism of all general agents, the mean threshold of all general agents beyond which they become active humanitarian actors, and the total population size. Each run of the model lasted 1500 time steps, during which time these global variables were updated. This was done by randomly selecting a percentage of agents from the general population based on the degrade-percent parameter and decreasing their humanitarianism value by a random amount between 0 and degrade-percent. This allowed us to simulate the effects of donor fatigue, which has been shown to be a major problem in long-term humanitarian efforts (e.g., [1]). The mean state and mean threshold were calculated using the current values of all general agents.
