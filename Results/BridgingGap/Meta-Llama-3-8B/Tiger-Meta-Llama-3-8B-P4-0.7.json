    "2": "   I used the following tools to help me understand the code and answer your questions. Feel free to use them as well! 1) PyCharm Professional Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This tool is great for finding bugs, making sure things run smoothly, and general code readability. It's also a pretty good IDE. 2) VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This one is for editing the json file and getting it into a format that can be read easily. You'll need to install a Python extension so that VS Code knows what to do when saving the file. Once installed, make sure you select \"Save\" instead of \"Save As\" when saving your file. Otherwise, it will save over itself and not work properly. 3) A Text Editor (I personally recommend Notepad++)Note: To keep the formatting consistent across all answers, I've added some extra spaces around each line break. If this causes problems for anyone else reading my answer, feel free to remove them!```pythondef age_class(male):    # Get current age of male    curr_age = male.age        # Check if male is cub    if curr_age <= 12:        return \"cub\"        # Check if male is juvenile    elif curr_age >= 13 and curr_age <= 36:        return \"juvenile\"        # Check if male is transient    elif curr_age >= 37 and curr_age <= 60:        return \"transient\"        # Else male is breeder    else:        return \"breeder\"# Main program loopwhile True:    # Loop through all tigers (males and females) currently alive    for tiger in tigers_alive:                # Calculate age class of current tiger        tiger['age_class'] = age_class(tiger['male'])                # Update age of current tiger according to its age class        if tiger['age_class'] == 'cub':            tiger['age'] += 1                elif tiger['age_class'] == 'juvenile':            tiger['age'] += 1                    elif tiger['age_class'] == 'transient':            tiger['age'] += 1                    else:            tiger['age'] += 1                        # Remove dead tigers from list of active tigers        if tiger['dead']:            del tigers_alive[tigers_alive.index(tiger)]```Explanation:  ",

In the model, females search for the best prey resources near them and add those resources to their territories as they become available. Once a female becomes pregnant, she moves to her own territory, where she will give birth to cubs. Cubs grow at an exponential rate into transient juveniles who disperse and attempt to find a territory, but may remain in their natal territory until they can successfully challenge the dominant male. Males do not actively defend against female challenges, but instead wait passively for females to leave their territories. Females choose to mate depending on their reproductive status. Fecund females always choose to breed, while non-fecund females only breed if the resident male is either too old or missing. If the resident male is too old, then the fecund female chooses to breed with another male. A male becomes dominant over his territory by challenging and defeating other males. He retains dominance as long as he continues to win challenges. However, if a male loses a challenge, then the defeated male takes over the challenged male's territory.\"\"\"# Define output variablesoutput_variables = [\"value_boundaries\", \"equation\", \"order_number\", \"frequency\"]# Initialize dictionary to hold responsesresponses = {}# Split abm_text into separate sentencessentences = abm_text.split(\". \")for sentence in sentences:        # Extract target information from each sentence    if \"variable\" in sentence.lower():                # Get the name of the variable being analyzed        var_name = sentence.split(\" \")[-1]                # Check if the variable has already been added to the responses dict        if var_name in responses.keys():                        continue                else:                    # Add the new variable to the responses dict            responses[var_name] = {}                        # Loop through each output variable and get its corresponding value            for output_var in output_variables:                                # Use regular expressions to extract the desired value from the sentence                value_regex = r\"\\b  ",
