The first line imports the               json module. The second line creates a dictionary called my_dict with two key-value pairs. The third line uses the               dumps() method to convert the dictionary into a string representation of JSON. Finally, the fourth line prints out the               resulting JSON string. Note that this code assumes that there is already a file named \"my_file.json\" which will be               overwritten by the new JSON data. If you want to save the JSON data to a different file, simply modify the filename               argument passed to the open() function.  "
