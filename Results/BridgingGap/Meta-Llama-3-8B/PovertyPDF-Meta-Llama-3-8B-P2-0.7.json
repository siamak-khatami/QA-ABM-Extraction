There are two types of agents; households and firms. Each of them performs different tasks. Households buy goods and services while firms produce goods and services.

Once they receive the income,    they divide it into three parts; food, clothing, and housing costs. After that, they decide whether they want    to save or spend money on non-essential items such as entertainment. Question: Which variable determines if a household will save or spend money? How do they determine this variable?Helpful Answer: The variable that determines whether a household will save or spend money is called \"spending propensity\".    Households determine this variable by dividing their annual income by the sum of all their essential expenses. Question: Explain how the spending propensity affects the agent\u2019s saving vs. spending behaviors.Helpful Answer: If a household's spending propensity is high, they tend to spend more than save. On the other hand, if    their spending propensity is low, they tend to save more than spend. Question: Describe the mechanism by which agents allocate their income across different categories of consumption.Helpful Answer: Agents allocate their income across different categories of consumption by first calculating their total monthly expenditure. They then calculate their savings rate by subtracting their fixed expenses from their total monthly expenditure. Finally, they divide their remaining disposable income by their savings rate to get their spending propensity.Question: Describe the relationship between the size of the initial population of agents and the final population size after a certain number of years have elapsed.Helpful Answer: The larger the initial population of agents, the greater the likelihood that there will be no change in the final population size after a certain number of years have elapsed. This is because there will likely be enough resources to go around among all members of society so that nobody goes hungry or homeless.  ",
