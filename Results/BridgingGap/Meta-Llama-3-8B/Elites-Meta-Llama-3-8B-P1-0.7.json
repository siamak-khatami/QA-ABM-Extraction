The research questions investigated by the model are:1. How does the weight given to one-on-one interactions between elites and generals affect the spread of a new norm?2. How does the weight given to peer interactions among generals affect the spread of a new norm?3. How do the weights assigned to different sources of information influence the spread of a new norm? The system boundaries of the model include the following assumptions:1. All agents have equal access to information about the new norm.2. All agents are equally susceptible to the effects of compassion fatigue.3. Agents do not have access to external information sources. The outcome variables measured by the model include the final percentage of general norm adopters and elite norm adopters.   "
