Each section begins with a brief descriptionof the key processes involved in the component under consideration, followed by the details of how it was implemented in the model. These sections are complemented by the appendixes describing the full source code of the model.2.2.1. Stream environmentinputs The daily stream environ-ment inputs for TRACE include water temperatureand stream \ufb02ow. We  used data collected by the closest meteorolog-ical (Urzainqui, AEMET [Spanish National Meteorological Agency])and stream gauging (Isaba, Navarra Government) stations to gen-erate the water temperature and \ufb02ow time series.2.2.2. Model parameterization and validationModel parameterization is extensively described in elements3 (\u201cData evaluation\u201d) and 6 (\u201cModel output veri\ufb01cation\u201d) of theTRACE document (Appendix A).In inSTREAM-Gen, 20 parameters de\ufb01ne the initial trout pop-ulation; their values are site-speci\ufb01c because they de\ufb01ne  ",

This equation has four main parts: (1) The energy gained through ingestion, (2) the cost of maintenance metabolism, (3) the cost of swimming against flow, and (4) the cost of finding food. Each part of the equation will be discussed separately below.\u2022\tFirst, we will discuss the \u201cEnergy Gained Through Ingestion.\u201d This part of the equation is given by:Eg = F*Wf/(T + T0)where Eg represents energy gained through ingestion, F represents the amount of food ingested per unit of time, Wf represents the energetic content of the food being eaten, T represents the total volume of food eaten over time, and T0 represents a constant that represents how much of the food is wasted before it is eaten. Note that since the units of F, Wf, T, and T0 are all grams, then the units of Eg are also grams. Since the weight gain equation uses mass rather than volume, this means that Eg must be multiplied by the density of the water (Dw) to get mass. Thus, the final equation is:Eg = Dw * F * Wf / (T + T0)Note that this equation assumes that there is no starvation (that is, that T > 0), so that all the fish are eating something. If the fish were starving (T = 0), then the equation would become:Eg = 0since the amount of food eaten would be zero. However, even if the fish are starving, the weight gain equation still does not assume that the fish die. Instead, the weight gain equation assumes that the fish are too weak to swim upstream and find food, but that they do manage to eat some food when it comes downstream towards them. Note that this assumption may be unrealistic for very small trout that cannot survive without eating food. In such cases, it might be better to simply set the entire population of very small trout to zero whenever T  ",
