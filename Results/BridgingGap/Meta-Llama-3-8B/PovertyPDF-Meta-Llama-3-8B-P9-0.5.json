We alsoanalyzed the impact of multiple parameter variations simultaneously. Thissensitivity analysis helped us understand the dynamics of poverty lines underdifferent scenarios and conditions. The results of this analysis are presentedbelow.4.We have run our model on several different configurations of income meanand income standard deviation. The results show that the change in incomemean affects the level of poverty line more than the income standard deviation.This indicates that the average income of the population plays a significant rolein determining the poverty line. However, it is important to note that boththese factors play a role in shaping the poverty line, but their relative importancedepends on the specific situation. The income standard deviation may becomemore influential when there are large fluctuations in income levels withinthe population.5.The results of our experiments indicate that the income mean and incomestandard deviation do not significantly affect the relationship between incomelevels and poverty line levels. This suggests that the poverty line does not varysignificantly across populations with different income means and income stan-dard deviations. However, further research is required to fully understand therelationship between these factors and poverty line levels.6.The model was tested against the real-world data from the World Bank\u2019sWorld Development Indicators database. The results showed that the modelwas able to predict the poverty line accurately. This demonstrates that themodel is effective in predicting poverty line levels and can be used to informpolicy decisions aimed at reducing poverty levels.7.The model was also tested against historical data from various countriesaround the world. The results showed that the model was able to capture thetrends in poverty line levels over time. This demonstrates that the model canbe used to track changes in poverty line levels over time and can provideinsights into the drivers behind such changes.8  ",

As discussed earlier, we ran 68,000 simulations to exploredifferent combinations of the parameters (reported in Table 3). We then calculatedthe mean and median of the demand gap variable across all runs, separately foreach income function. The results are presented in Figure 3. To visualize therelationship between the mean demand gap and the income mean, we plotted thedata points against the income mean. These data points were obtained by varyingthe income mean from 0 to 200 while keeping other parameters constant. Theresults show that the mean demand gap increases with increasing income mean.However, there is considerable variation in the demand gap among the differentincome functions. The logarithmic function shows the lowest mean demand gap,followed by the exponential and linear functions. Furthermore, the mean demandgap is higher for the linear function than for the exponential function. Theseobservations indicate that the shape of the income function plays a significant rolein determining the mean demand gap. However, it is worth noting that the linearfunction exhibits a high degree of variability  ",
    "8": "   12Khatami and FrantzThe exponential function represents a rapid increase in income over time,while the logarithmic function represents a slow increase in income over time.The other two functions represent more extreme cases where either incomeincreases very rapidly (exponential) or very slowly (logarithmic).The second parameter affecting income dynamics is the income_std (standard deviation),which affects how quickly the income function changes its direction (Figure 3).A higher standard deviation implies that the income function will change itsdirection more frequently than if it were lower. It also means that the incomefunction will fluctuate more over time.The third parameter affecting income dynamics is the income_dir_change_step(the size of the step when the income function changes its direction). A higherincome_dir_change_step indicates that the income function will change its directionmore gradually than if it were lower. It also means that the income function willfluctuate less over time.Fig. 3: Income dynamics affected by income_std and income_dir_change_step.When the income_std is low, the income function will change its directionless often.
