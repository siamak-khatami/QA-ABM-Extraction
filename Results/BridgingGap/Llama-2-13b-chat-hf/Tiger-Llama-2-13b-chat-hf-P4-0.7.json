This means that the age of a female tiger can range from 1 month to 180 months (15 years).* Equation: The equation for calculating the 'Age' variable is \"Age = (Months - 1) * 12\". This equation calculates the age of a female tiger in months by subtracting 1 from the number of months and then multiplying the result by 12.* Order number: The order number for the 'Age' variable is 2. This indicates that the 'Age' variable is calculated second in the sequence of calculations for the 'Female Tigers' agent.* Frequency: The frequency of execution for the 'Age' variable is \"Monthly\". This means that the 'Age' variable is calculated every month for each female tiger in the simulation.  ",
