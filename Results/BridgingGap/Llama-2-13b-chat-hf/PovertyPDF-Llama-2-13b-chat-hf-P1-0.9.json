    "0": "  The model's purpose is to explore the dynamics of poverty lines using agent-based modeling. It simulates how people's income, consumption, and savings behaviors affect their poverty status. The research questions include understanding how changes in income distribution impact poverty rates, how different policy interventions influence poverty dynamics, and how poverty thresholds evolve over time. The system boundaries encompass essential investment goods, citizen preferences, and government policies. Outcome variables include poverty incidence, median income level, and income inequality metrics like the Gini coefficient.  ",
    "1": "   The provided ABM text describes an Essential Investment Goods (EIG) model for simulating poverty lines using agent-based modeling (ABM). The model's primary purpose is to explore the dynamics of poverty lines using ABM, specifically focusing on the analysis of very specific cases with emphasis on modeling distinct communities. The research questions addressed by the model include understanding how citizens' desired and required demands change over time, how income patterns turn over, and how emergency savings preference affects the consumption of essential investment goods. The system boundaries of the model include the minimum amount of equity savings, the price of investment goods, and the number of citizens. The outcome variables of the model include the median income level, the share of eig in demands, and the proportion of rents in the basket of goods.  ",
