The 'equation' field provides the mathematical formula used to calculate the 'percent-elites' variable, which is based on the difference between the'mu_activist_state' and'mu_activist_threshold' variables, divided by 2, and then exponentiated. The 'order_number' field indicates the order in which the variable is executed during the simulation, which is 2. Finally, the 'frequency' field specifies how often the variable is updated during the simulation, which is every 10 time steps.  ",
