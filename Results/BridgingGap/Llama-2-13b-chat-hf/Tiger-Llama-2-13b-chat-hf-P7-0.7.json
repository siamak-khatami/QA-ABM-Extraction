This is because the cell coordinates are discrete and can only take on integer values.Equation: There is no explicit equation for the 'cell coordinates' variable, as it is simply a set of discrete values.Order Number: The order number for the 'cell coordinates' variable is 1, as it is a single variable that is being updated at each time step.Frequency: The 'cell coordinates' variable is updated always (i.e., at every time step) during the simulation.Please note that the above answer is based on my understanding of the provided ABM text, and may not be entirely accurate or complete.
