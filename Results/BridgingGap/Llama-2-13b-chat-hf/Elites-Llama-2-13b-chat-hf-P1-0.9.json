The model examines the role of peer pressure, elite behavior, and activist zeal in shaping humanitarian opinions. It also investigates how degradation of humanitarian values due to compassion fatigue or other factors impacts the adoption of norms. The research questions include understanding the impact of advocate weight, elite weight, and peer weight on general agents' adoption of humanitarian norms. Additionally, the study will examine how the degradation of humanitarian values affects the adoption of norms and the overall effectiveness of advocacy strategies.  ",
