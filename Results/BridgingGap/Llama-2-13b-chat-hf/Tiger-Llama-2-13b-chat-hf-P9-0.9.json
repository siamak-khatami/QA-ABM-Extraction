Therefore, I cannot extract any information related to this variable. However, I can suggest some possible ways to address this gap in the ABM text.Firstly, it is essential to define the 'total_population' variable and its associated parameters, such as value boundaries, equation, order number, and frequency of execution. This will help establish a clear understanding of the model's behavior and enable further analysis and simulation.Secondly, it may be helpful to consult relevant literature or expert opinions to determine appropriate value boundaries, equations, and frequencies of execution for the 'total_population' variable. This could involve considering factors such as population growth rates, carrying capacities, and environmental constraints.Lastly, it may be necessary to modify the ABM text to include explicit definitions and specifications for the 'total_population' variable and its associated parameters. This could involve adding new code blocks or modifying existing ones to accurately represent the desired model behavior.  ",
