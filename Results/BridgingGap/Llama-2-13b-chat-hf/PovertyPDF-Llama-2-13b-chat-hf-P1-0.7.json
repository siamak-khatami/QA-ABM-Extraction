The model investigates how changes in income affect poverty lines and how poverty lines impact consumption patterns. The research questions include understanding the effects of different income distribution patterns on poverty lines and examining how changes in EIG prices influence poverty lines. The system boundaries include the citizens' desired and required demands, income mean and standard deviation, and the minimum amount of equity savings. The outcome variables include the poverty line, consumption patterns, and the portion of rents in the basket of goods.  ",
