However, based on the         discussion of the model and its parameters, it can be inferred that the value boundaries for 'total_population' are likely to be         non-negative integers, possibly with a minimum value of 0 and no upper bound.Equation:The equation for the 'total_population' variable is not explicitly defined in the provided ABM text. However, based on the         discussion of the model and its parameters, it can be inferred that the equation for 'total_population' may involve a sum or         product of the population sizes of the different age classes, possibly with some adjustments based on factors such as         mortality rates, birth rates, and migration between age classes.Order Number:The order number for the 'total_population' variable is not explicitly defined in the provided ABM text. However, based on the         discussion of the model and its parameters, it can be inferred that the order number for 'total_population' may be relatively         high, possibly in the range of tens to hundreds, depending on the complexity of the model and the number of parameters involved.Frequency:The frequency of execution for the 'total_population' variable is not explicitly defined in the provided ABM text. However, based on the         discussion of the model and its parameters, it can be inferred that the frequency of execution for 'total_population' may be relatively         low, possibly once per year or less frequently, depending on the specific application and requirements of the model.JSON Object:Here is the extracted data in JSON format:{ \"Model-Level\": { \"total_population\": { \"value_boundaries\": [0, infinity], \"equation\": null, \"order_number\": null, \"frequency\": null } } }  ",
