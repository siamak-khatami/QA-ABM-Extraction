    "0": "  Please review the provided ABM text and extract the relevant information using the specified format. Here's a breakdown of the required fields:Value Boundaries: The range of possible values for the 'percent-elites' variable. For example, if the variable can take on values between 0% and 100%, the value boundaries would be [0, 100].Equation: The mathematical expression representing how the 'percent-elites' variable changes over time. This could be a simple formula or a more complex algorithm.Order Number: The order in which the 'percent-elites' variable is executed during the simulation. For example, if the variable is updated before other variables in the model, its order number might be lower than those variables.Frequency: How often the 'percent-elites' variable is updated during the simulation. This could be expressed as a fixed number of time steps or as a function of some other variable.Please note that the provided ABM text does not explicitly state the value boundaries, equation, order number, or frequency of execution for the 'percent-elites' variable. However, based on the text, we can infer some information about these aspects of the model.Value Boundaries: Based on the text, it seems that the 'percent-elites' variable can take on values between 0% and 100%. Specifically, the text states that \"the number of elite norm adopters is relatively robust to starting conditions for opinion\" and \"most simulation runs stabilize after about 100 time steps.\" This suggests that the variable can take on values within a range of 0% to 100%.Equation: The text does not explicitly state the equation for the 'percent-elites' variable. However, based on the text, it seems that the variable may be updated based on some combination of elite and general agent interactions. Specifically, the text mentions that \"elite agents push this opinion to general agents in their network,\" which suggests that the 'percent-elites' variable may be influenced by the interactions between elite and general agents.Order Number: Based on the text, it seems that the 'percent-elites' variable is updated after the general agents have been updated. Specifically, the text states that \"the number of elite and general norm adopters is relatively robust to starting conditions for opinion,\" which  ",
