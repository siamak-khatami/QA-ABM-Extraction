The equation represents the mathematical relationship between the cell coordinates variable and other variables in the model, which is a function of income, current demand level, and citizen required demand. The order number represents the order in which the equation is executed during each time step, which is 2 in this case. Finally, the frequency represents how often the equation is executed, which is annually in this case.  ",
