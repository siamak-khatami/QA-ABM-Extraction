    "2": "  The provided ABM text describes the 'Humanitarian Advocates' agent and its 'advocate_zeal' variable. Based on the text, here is the           information regarding the 'advocate_zeal' variable:Value Boundaries: The value boundaries for 'advocate_zeal' are [0, 1]. This means that the variable can take any value between           0 and 1, inclusive of both values.Equation: There is no explicit equation defined for 'advocate_zeal' in the provided text. However, based on the context, it appears           that the value of 'advocate_zeal' is determined by some unknown function or rule, as it is mentioned that advocates           have homogeneous values for humanitarianism, but there is no explicit formula given.Order Number: The order number for 'advocate_zeal' is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the context, it seems           likely that the variable is updated after all one-on-one interactions have been processed, as advocates only interact           one-on-one with general agents and update their opinion based on these interactions. Therefore, the order number           for 'advocate_zeal' would likely be close to the end of the simulation loop.Frequency: The frequency of execution for 'advocate_zeal' is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the context, it           seems likely that the variable is updated after every time step, as advocates continuously interact with general agents           and update their opinion based on these interactions. Therefore, the frequency of execution for 'advocate_zeal'           would likely be once per time step.Here is the extracted data in JSON format:{ 'Humanitarian Advocates':{ 'advocate_zeal': { 'value_boundaries': [0, 1], 'equation': null, 'order_number': null,                                                          'frequency': 'once per time step' } }}  ",
