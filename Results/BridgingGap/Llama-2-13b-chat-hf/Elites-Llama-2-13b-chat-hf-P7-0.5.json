The object has four properties: 'value_boundaries', 'equation', 'order_number', and 'frequency'. Each property is described below:Value Boundaries: This property contains an array of possible values that the 'advocate_weight_g' variable can take. The values are represented as strings and are enclosed in parentheses. The array contains six values: \"(0.005)\", \"(0.009)\", \"(0.009)\", \"advocate_weight_g\", \"-1.664\", and \"-10.418**\".Equation: This property contains the mathematical equation that defines how the 'advocate_weight_g' variable changes over time. The equation is represented as a string and is given by \"advocate_weight_g = -1.664 - 10.418*advocate_zeal + 11.492*elite_weight\".Order Number: This property contains the order number of the variable in the model. The order number is represented as an integer and is given by 2.Frequency: This property contains the frequency at which the variable is updated in the model. The frequency is represented as a string and is given by \"every 200 time steps\".  ",
