    "1": "  The provided ABM text describes a model of tiger population dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The model includes variables such as tiger density, prey biomass, and spatially explicit information about the location of tigers and their prey. To analyze the text and extract the relevant information related to the 'cell coordinates' variable of model space, we can identify the following:Value Boundaries: The value boundaries for the 'cell coordinates' variable are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the context, we can infer that the values must fall within the range of -1 to 1, representing the spatial coordinates of the cells.Equation: There is no explicit equation mentioned for the 'cell coordinates' variable. However, based on the description of the model, we can infer that the variable represents the spatial location of the tigers and their prey, and its value is determined by the cell coordinates where the tiger or prey is located.Order of Execution: The order of execution for the 'cell coordinates' variable is not specified in the text. However, based on the model architecture, we can assume that the variable is executed after the 'territory' and 'prey biomass' variables, as the value of the 'cell coordinates' variable depends on the location of the tigers and their prey.Frequency of Execution: The frequency of execution for the 'cell coordinates' variable is also not specified in the text. However, based on the model architecture, we can assume that the variable is executed every time step, as the value of the 'cell coordinates' variable is updated based on the current location of the tigers and their prey.Therefore, the extracted JSON object would look like this:{'SPACE':{'cell coordinates':{'value_boundaries': [-1, 1], 'equation': None, 'order_number': 3, 'frequency': EveryTimeStep } } }Note that the 'value_boundaries' field specifies the range of values that the 'cell coordinates' variable can take, while the 'equation' field is left empty as there is no explicit equation mentioned for the variable. The 'order_number' field indicates the order in which the variable is executed relative to other variables in the model, while the 'frequency' field specifies the frequency at which the variable is executed.
