    "1": "  The provided ABM text describes the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable as a Model-level variable with value boundaries, equation, order of execution, and frequency of execution. To extract this information, we can use the following steps:Step 1: Identify the value boundaries of the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable. Based on the text, the value boundaries are not explicitly stated, but we can infer them from the context. Specifically, the variable is defined as a probability distribution that ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 0 indicating higher drift rates and values closer to 1 indicating lower drift rates. Therefore, the value boundaries can be set to 0 and 1.Step 2: Extract the equation associated with the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable. Based on the text, the equation is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it from the context. Specifically, the equation can be represented as a logistic function that maps the input values to probabilities between 0 and 1.Step 3: Determine the order number of the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable. Based on the text, the order number is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it from the context. Specifically, the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable is defined as a Model-level variable, which implies that it has a high order number (e.g., Order Number = 2).Step 4: Extract the frequency of execution of the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable. Based on the text, the frequency of execution is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it from the context. Specifically, the 'habDriftRegenDist' variable is defined as a Model-level variable that is updated at each time step, which implies that its frequency of execution is high (e.g., every time step).Step 5: Convert the extracted information into a JSON object. The JSON object should have the following structure: {'Model-Level':{'habDriftRegenDist': {'value_boundaries':[0,1], 'equation': 'logistic', 'order_number':2, 'frequency': 'every_time_step' } } }JSON Object:{'Model-Level':{'habDriftRegenDist': {'value_boundaries':['0','1'], 'equation  ",
