    "0": "   The provided ABM text describes a simulation environment that involves humanitarianism and              three types of agents, including elite, general, and free agents. The simulation space is designed to              explore the diffusion of norms among these agents, specifically examining how the elite agents influence               the general agents' adoption of humanitarian norms. The short description of the simulation space                highlights the focus on the role of elite agents in shaping the opinions of general agents. Based on this                 information, the JSON object would be structured as follows:                  {'Space': {'short_description': 'exploring the diffusion of norms among elite and general agents',                          'type': 'humanitarianism and agent-based modeling'}}  ",
