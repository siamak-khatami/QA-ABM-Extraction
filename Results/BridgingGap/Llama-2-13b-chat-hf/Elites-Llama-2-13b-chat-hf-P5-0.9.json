    "6": "   The provided text describes an ABM simulation space that includes three different types of agents, each with its own set of parameters. The simulation space is designed to explore the adoption of norms among these agents, specifically examining how norms diffuse through a population. The text mentions a Latin Hypercube design with 100 parameter combinations or design points, and each point being repeated five times. Additionally, the text references a variety of sources related to norm diffusion and adoption, including works by Axelrod, Lopez, Epstein, and Elster. Based on this information, the JSON object could be structured as follows:JSON Object:{\"Space\": {\"short_description\": \"ABM simulation space exploring norm adoption among different types of agents\",\"type\": \"norm_adoption_simulation\"}}  ",
