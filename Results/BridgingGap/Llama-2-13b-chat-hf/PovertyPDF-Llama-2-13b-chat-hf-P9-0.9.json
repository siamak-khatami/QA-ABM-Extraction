However, we can infer that the variable represents a continuous range of values based on the parameterization of the income function. Specifically, the income function includes parameters such as 'a' and 'time', which suggest a linear or exponential relationship between income and time. Therefore, we can assume that the value boundaries for 'income_mean' are continuous and potentially unbounded.Equation: The equation for the income function is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the parameterization of the income function, we can infer that the equation takes the form of a linear or exponential function of the form:income_mean = a \\* time + bwhere 'a' and 'b' are constants that determine the shape of the function.Order Number: Based on the provided text, it appears that the 'income_mean' variable is updated at every time step, indicating that its order number is 1.Frequency: The frequency of execution for the 'income_mean' variable is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
