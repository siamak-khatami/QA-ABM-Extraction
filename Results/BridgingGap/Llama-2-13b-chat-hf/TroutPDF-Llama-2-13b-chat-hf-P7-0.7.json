The 'equation' string represents the mathematical expression for calculating the cell values, which is a simple function of Age. The 'order_number' integer indicates the order of execution of the equation, which is 2, indicating that the equation will be executed twice during each simulation run. Finally, the 'frequency' integer specifies how often the equation will be executed, which is 1, meaning that the equation will be executed once per simulation run.  ",
