Equation: The equation for density age-1 (trout/ha) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, we         can infer that the equation may be a simple regression equation based on the observed pattern of density         versus age.    Order of execution: The order of execution for the density age-1 (trout/ha) variable is not explicitly mentioned         in the provided text. However, we can infer that the variable may be executed first in the model, as it is         one of the input parameters for the simulation.
