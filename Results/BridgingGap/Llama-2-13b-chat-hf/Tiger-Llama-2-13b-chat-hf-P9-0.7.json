    "0": "   Here is the analysis of the provided ABM text to identify and extract the value boundaries, equation, order of           execution, and frequency of execution related to the 'total_population' variable of Model-level variables:Value Boundaries:The value boundaries for the 'total_population' variable are not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the          description of the model, it can be inferred that the value boundaries are likely to be integers or real numbers           between 0 and 1000, representing the total population size of the model.Equation:No explicit equation for the 'total_population' variable is provided in the text. However, based on the description of          the model, it can be inferred that the equation would relate to the growth or decline of the population over time,           possibly involving parameters such as birth rate, death rate, and migration rate.Order Number:The order number for the 'total_population' variable is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the          description of the model, it can be inferred that the order number would be relatively high, possibly around          10 or higher, given the complexity of the model and the numerous interactions between variables.Frequency:The frequency of execution for the 'total_population' variable is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based          on the description of the model, it can be inferred that the frequency of execution would be relatively low,           possibly once per year or longer, given the long-term nature of the model and the fact that many variables are           only updated periodically based on external events.JSON Object:Here is the extracted data in JSON format:{ 'Model-Level': { 'total_population': { 'value_boundaries': [0, 1000], 'equation': null, 'order_number': null,                                                                    'frequency': null } } }  ",

This range represents the possible values of the total population variable in the model, considering both female and male populations.Equation: The equation for total_population is a simple summation of female_population and male_population. This equation is straightforward and does not involve any complex calculations or nonlinear relationships.Order Number: The order number for total_population is 1, indicating that it is one of the primary variables in the model and is calculated before other variables.Frequency: Total population is calculated always, meaning that it is evaluated every time step in the simulation. This is because the total population is a critical variable that determines the overall health and stability of the tiger population in the model.  ",
